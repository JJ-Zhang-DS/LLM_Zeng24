    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "I loaded 11 literatures from the local disk using a directory loader for RAG and chatbot. THe contents are about genetic breeding which is used for seeds innovation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This homework includes the following steps:**\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup**\n",
    "    - Import necessary libraries and modules.\n",
    "    - Load environment variables from `.env` file to get the API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Processing**\n",
    "    - Extract text from multiple PDF files and save each to a separate text file.\n",
    "    - Load documents from the local disk using a directory loader.\n",
    "    - Split documents into smaller chunks for better processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding Creation**\n",
    "    - Create embeddings for each chunk using OpenAI embeddings.\n",
    "    - Create a retriever from the vector store to fetch relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Conversational Chain Setup**\n",
    "    - Initialize the chat model.\n",
    "    - Create a memory object to store the conversation history.\n",
    "    - Create a conversational retrieval chain by combining the chat model, retriever, and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Interaction**\n",
    "    - Start an infinite loop to interact with the user.\n",
    "    - Continuously receive user input and respond using the conversational retrieval chain.\n",
    "    - Exit the loop if the user inputs \"exit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "1. **Document Processing:** I had difficulty in reading the PDF files by DirectoryLoader. \n",
    "2. **performance:** The performance of the chatbot is not good enough. It can retrieved the relevant information but it is not deep enough. May need more data and better model to improve the performance.\n",

      "These considerations can help in optimizing genetic breeding strategies for improved crop varieties with desirable traits.\n",
      "Human: what is the pickfall \n",
      "Assistant: Pitfalls to consider in genetic breeding include factors such as the size of training and breeding populations, genetic diversity of the breeding population, heritability of the trait being targeted, genotype-environment interactions, density of markers, and genetic relationships between training and breeding populations or selection candidates. Other factors that may influence genomic prediction accuracy include the influence of various genetic and environmental factors, as well as the overall complexity of the breeding process. It's important to address these factors to ensure the accuracy and success of genetic breeding programs.\n",
      "Human: what is the advantages \n",
      "Assistant: Some advantages of genetic breeding include enhancing traits like yield, disease resistance, and quality in crops over time. Genomic tools provide precise insights into genetic variations, speeding up trait identification, and enabling targeted modifications. These tools help identify desirable traits more accurately and rapidly, reducing the time and cost of developing improved plant varieties compared to traditional breeding methods.\n",
      "Human: what should I start to learn for this field\n",
      "Assistant: To start learning about genetic breeding, you can begin with a foundational understanding of quantitative genetics principles. Additionally, familiarize yourself with theoretical concepts and applied breeding methods in both plant and animal breeding. It would also be beneficial to explore the concepts and tools related to Genomic Selection (GS) since it has the potential to unify plant and animal breeding. Finally, studying the practical implementation of genomic selection in crop and livestock breeding programs can provide valuable insights into the field.\n",
      "Human: what is the disadvantage\n",
      "Assistant: Some disadvantages of genetic breeding include the cost associated with technologies like doubled-haploid (DH) technology, the need for extensive phenotyping, and factors that can affect the accuracy of genomic predictions such as the size and genetic diversity of breeding populations, heritability of traits, genotype-environment interactions, marker density, and genetic relationships between populations.\n",
