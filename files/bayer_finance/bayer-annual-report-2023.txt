Chairman’s Letter  
 
  
 
 
 
I’ve been at Bayer since last April. Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to get to know 
the people and the products that make up this great company all around the world.  I’ve spoken to our customers, our colleagues in the research labs and the green-
houses, our marketing experts, and the scientists responsible for developing new medi-
cines and agricultural products.  
Bayer is home to a wealth of expertise and incredible creative potential. Each encounter 
I’ve had has only heightened my enthusiasm for this company and its possibilities.  
I say that even though we have experienced some difficult setbacks and are facing some material challenges.  
Rest assured that we will not allow ourselves to become discouraged. On the contrary: 
These setbacks drive us to get so much better and to demonstrate the potential that this company holds. We are currently in th e process of fundamentally changing the way 
our company operates – to make Bayer faster and better-performing. 
 
Adjusted guidance reached, but no t satisfied with the results 
This report contains our 2023 business performance. Although we reached our  
adjusted guidance, we cannot be satisfied wi th the results. Our sales of €47.6 billion –  
adjusted for currency and portfolio effect s – were one percent lower than in the  
prior year. EBITDA before special items fell by some 13 percent to €11.7 billion.  
And our core earnings per share, at €6.39, were  almost 20 percent lower year on year.  
Business performance in our three divisions varied widely. While sales and earnings at 
Crop Science declined significantly compared with the prior year, business performance 
at Consumer Health continued to be positive. At Pharmaceuticals, sales were level year on year on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis, but earnings fell substantially. 
 

 
 
 
 To our Stockholders
Chairman’s LetterBayer Annual Report 2023 7
 
        
 
 
  
With regard to our dividend, we put forwar d a proposal to pay out only the legally  
required minimum for the next three years. We didn’t take this decision lightly, but one 
of the company’s top priorities is reducing debt and increasing flexibility. This would  
result in a dividend of €0.11 per share for fiscal year 2023, which we will propose at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.  
On top of our high debt load, we continue  to be burdened by litigation in the  
United States. We have won some lawsuits but lost others, and we have seen some  unprecedented damages awards. We have filed appeals against the adverse verdicts 
and will continue to defend ourselves vigorousl y. The scientific and regulatory facts are 
on our side, as was demonstrated again last year, when the safety of glyphosate was confirmed by its reapproval in the European Union. We will make every effort to ensure 
that the plaintiff attorneys are not allowed to misrepresent these facts in court. After all, 
we want to invest our resources in innovation, not in the US litigation industry.    
We faced another setback in November 2023, when a major Phase III trial investigating 
our anticoagulant asundexian in patients with atrial fibrillation and the risk of stroke was 
discontinued. That was a big disappointment for all of us, even though we are well aware that this is always a risk for every ph armaceutical company. It is an unavoidable 
part of the search for medical breakthrou ghs. We will continue to investigate  
asundexian and are proceeding with our trial of this substance in stroke prevention.  
Bayer CEO Bill Anderson  
 
 
 
 To our Stockholders
Chairman’s LetterBayer Annual Report 2023 8
We also have other promising candidates in our portfolio and are making good  
progress with them.   
These setbacks have had a very negative impact on our share price. Let’s be clear: The 
current trajectory is unacceptable. That’s why we have initiated a radical transformation of our company – and we’re committed to regaining trust.  
 
A new operating model to boost performance 
Bayer has huge potential. But as in many large companies, we often make life difficult 
for ourselves. There is a whole lot of coordination, monitoring and supervision going on. 
In some areas, we have 12 hierarchy levels between the CEO and the customer.  
Why is that a problem? Because this traditional approach of top-down management 
doesn’t place products and customers at the heart of daily work. Decisions take far too 
long. Initiative and creativity are stifled by bureaucracy. 
That’s why we want to turn our system on its head. In th e future, 95 percent of the  
decision-making will shift to the people actu ally doing the work. We are introducing a 
new operating model, which we call Dynamic Shared Ownership. This new system will  reduce hierarchy levels, eliminate bureaucracy and significantly accelerate decision-
making. We will primarily work in small, self-managed teams, totally focused on  
improving our products and the lives of our cu stomers. This shift will enable us to  
unleash the entrepreneurial power of each individual and ensure that all of our efforts  are focused on the needs of consumers, patients and farmers.  
Already, 4,000 colleagues are involved, and we plan to roll out the system to every part 
of Bayer. We want to reach each area of the company by the end of 2024.  
This change will also lead to a considerab le number of job redu ctions. That is a  
necessary consequence of reducing hierarchy levels and making the company leaner. We will proceed in a fair and socially respon sible manner, as has always been the way at 
Bayer. In Germany, we have reached an agreement with the employee representatives 
on the Supervisory Board in the form of a Joint Declaration.  
I am well aware that the changes within the company will have a significant impact on 
our employees. However, these steps are necessary to get Bayer swiftly back on track. 
And the result will create much more meanin gful jobs. The people of Bayer share this  
  
 
 
 
 To our Stockholders
Chairman’s LetterBayer Annual Report 2023 9
view. They are looking forward to holding greater responsibility for their company.  
And I would like to offer my sincere thanks to our employee representatives and our 
people worldwide for the excellent results they have achieved during the past year,  
despite some challenging conditions.  
 
Innovation to drive our mission forward 
Last year, Team Bayer once again demonstrated our creativity and innovative power. 
Here are just a few examples of how we are driving our mission forward.  
Our team at Crop Science is launching inno vation that will make agriculture both  
more productive and more environmentally friendly over the coming decades. One  such innovation is the Preceon™ Smart Corn System, which makes corn more resilient 
in extreme weather conditions by reducing its height. We have also launched our  
new system for direct-seeded rice in India, which can lower greenhouse gas emissions  and water consumption by up to 40 percent. This innovation has the potential to  revolutionize the production of rice, a staple crop for nearly half the world!  
At Pharmaceuticals, we have reached importan t milestones in our clinical trials in the 
field of cell and gene therapy for the treatment  of Parkinson’s disease. In addition, two 
molecules from our chemoproteomics platform have also reached the clinical testing 
phase. We hope that these programs will one day enable us to help cancer patients 
whose needs are currently unmet.    
We have also made considerable progress in our late-stage pipeline, where seven of 
our drug candidates are now moving toward marketing authorization. We have seen very positive results in two studies of our potential blockbuster e linzanetant, which is 
being developed for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Furthermore, we have  
received regulatory approval for Eylea™ 8 mg in both the European Union and Japan, which will put us in a position to sustain ma rket leadership in the treatment of two  
serious forms of eye disease. And our recently launched products Nubeqa™ for cancer 
and Kerendia™ for heart and kidney disease are continuing to grow rapidly and in  additional countries.  
At Consumer Health, we have set up a new Precision Health unit to develop custom-
ized digital solutions that help people make better-informed and more individualized self-care decisions. We also had major product launches last year. In China, for  
example, we strengthened our Elevit™ nutrit ional supplement brand, and in Europe we 
entered the attractive probiotics market with an oral product for women’s intimate health.  
  
 
 
 
 To our Stockholders
Chairman’s LetterBayer Annual Report 2023 10
We have also systematically implemented ou r sustainability strategy over the past  
year, and we remain on track to achieve our ambitious targets. One of the highlights  
in 2023 was the landmark agreement that we signed in the United States, which will  
enable us to secure 40 percent of our global electricity demand out of renewable  energy sources in the future. We also presented our new water strategy at the  
UN Water Conference in New York, which will make water stewardship an integral  
part of our business and investment decisions. We are one of the first companies in  the world to take such a step. 
All of these advances in innovation and sustainability show what our company is  
capable of. And we are still hitting our stride. We will make every effort to realize this potential in full. We remain focused on our vital mission of Health for all, Hunger  
for none , and we will put aside everything that is off-mission. We have set ourselves  
ambitious targets to make sure that Bayer is a faster, better and more innovative  company in the future, for the benefit of our shareholders and everyone else we serve. Thank you for being a part of our journey.  
Sincerely,

Report of the Supervisory BoardBayer Annual Report 2023 12
Report of the Supervisory Board 
 
2023 was a challenging year for Bayer. Various external factors such as global cr ises, wars, high inflation 
and raw-material prices, and unfavorable exchange ra te developments had a negative effect on Bayer’s 
business. From the Supervisory Board’s perspective, business performance was not satisfactory. That is 
why, in addition to the company’s strategic alignm ent, the Supervisory Board also specifically focused 
on the identified problem areas, su ch as the continuing glyphosate and PCB litigations in the United 
States, the company’s high leverage  ratio, and the further developmen t of the pharmaceutical pipeline.  
In addition to performing extensive oversight aro und these issues, the Supervisory Board addressed in 
particular the reorganization of Bayer’s leadership team. In February, it appo inted Bill Anderson as a 
member of the Board of Management effective April 1, and Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) 
effective June 1. The Supervisory Board also appo inted a new Chief Talent Officer in 2023, making  
Heike Prinz a member of the Board of Management and Labor Director. In addition, the Supervisory 
Board engaged in deliberations in  relation to its own composition. At the 2024 Annual Stockholders’ 
Meeting, it will propose the reelect ion of two members with a proven tr ack record, as well as the election 
of three new members to succeed members who are stepping down. 
During 2023, the Supervisory Board monitored the conduct of the company’s business by the Board of 
Management on a regular basis with the aid of detaile d written and oral reports received from the Board of 
Management, and also acted in an advisory capacity. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
maintained a constant exchange of information with  the respective Chairman and the other members of 
the Board of Management. Furthermore, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee were regularly in direct contact – incl uding outside of the meetings – with the heads of 
the Law, Patents, Insurance, Compliance and Data Pr ivacy unit, Internal Audit,  and the Taxes, Treasury 
and Accounting unit. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee was regularly in direct contact with 
the head of the Global Compliance and Data Privacy de partment, including outside of the meetings. In this 
way, the Supervisory Board was kept continuously informed about the compan y’s intended business  
strategy, corporate planning (including financial, in vestment and human resources planning) and earnings  
performance, as well as the state of the business and the situation in the company and the Group.  
Where Board of Management decisions or actions re quired the approval of the Supervisory Board, 
whether by law or under the Articles of Incorporation or the rules of procedure, the draft resolutions were 
inspected by the members at the meetings of the full Supervisory Board, sometimes after preparatory work

Work of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board convened eight times in 2023. The attendance rate of the individual Supervisory 
Board members at the meetings of the Supervisory Board an d its committees is disclosed at the end of 
this Report.  
The members of the Board of Management generally attended the meetings of the Supervisory Board. 
However, the Supervisory Board also  met regularly without the Board of Management or with only the 
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) present. Each ordinary meeting formally includes an “execu-
tive session” as a separate agenda item, during wh ich no Board of Management members are present.  
Ordinary Audit Committee meetings al so include executive sessions that  involve the Audit Committee con-
sulting with the auditor without the presence of the Board of Management.

Financial statements and audits 
The financial statements of Bayer AG were prepar ed according to the requir ements of the German  
Commercial Code and Stock Corporation Act. The cons olidated financial statements of the Bayer Group 
were prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the  
European Union. The applicable fu rther requirements of Section 315a of the German Commercial Code 
were also taken into account. The Combined Manageme nt Report was prepared according to the German 
Commercial Code.  
The auditor, Deloitte GmbH Wirtsc haftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, ha s audited the financial statements 
of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements  of the Bayer Group and the Combined Management 
Report. The auditor responsible for th e audit was Michael Mehren. The cond uct of the audit is explained in 
the auditor’s reports. The auditor finds that Bayer has complied, as appropriate, with the German Com-
mercial Code, the German Stock Corporation Act and/ or the International Financial Reporting Standards 
endorsed by the European Union, an d issues an unqualified opinion on the financial statements of Bayer 
AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Ba yer Group and the Combined Management Report. The 
financial statements of Bayer AG, th e consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group, the Combined 
Management Report and the audit reports were submitted to all memb ers of the Supervisory Board.  
They were discussed in detail by the Audit Committee and at a meeting of the fu ll Supervisory Board. The 
auditor submitted a report on both occasions  and was present duri ng the discussions. 
We examined the financial statements of Bayer AG, th e proposal by the Board of Management for the use 
of the distributable profit, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the Combined Management Report. While examining the Combined Mana gement Report, we also examined in particular 
the nonfinancial statement, which is fully integrated  into the Management Report and was also examined 
by the auditor. We have no ob jections, and thus we concur wi th the result of the audit.  
We have approved the financial statements of Bayer AG and the consolidated financial statements of  
the Bayer Group prepared by the Board of Management . The financial statements of Bayer AG are thus 
confirmed. We are in agreement with the Combined Ma nagement Report and, in particular, with the as-
sessment of the future development of the enterprise. We also concur with the dividend policy and the  
decisions concerning earnings retent ion by the company. We assent to  the proposal by the Board of  
Management for the use of the distributable profit, wh ich provides for payment of a dividend of €0.11 per 
share and the allocation of the remainin g amount to other retained earnings. 
The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Board of Management and all employees for their  
dedication and hard work in 2023.

Difficult year on the stock market for Bayer AG and our stockholders 
2023 was a difficult year on the stock market for our company and our stockholders as a number of 
factors weighed down the Bayer share price. The gu idance downgrade for full-y ear 2023 in July, the 
discontinuation of an important Phase III trial involv ing our investigational drug asundexian, and further 
uncertainties around the litigations were among the major headwinds. Addi tional factors included 
challenging market dynamics for Crop Science, ongoi ng price declines in key pharmaceutical markets, 
the rise in inflation and unfavorab le exchange rate developments. 
Following the change at the helm of the company in  the middle of the year, our new CEO Bill Anderson 
announced plans to work together with the entire workforce to accelerate innova tion, improve performance 
and leverage the company’s full potential moving forward. 
Despite stabilizing toward the end of the year, Baye r stock closed the year down 27.5% against 2022, 
at €33.63 per share. The German stock index (DAX 40) was up 20.3% over the same period, while the EURO STOXX 50 rose by 22.2%. Bayer AG’s market capitalization fell by €14. 5 billion to €33 billion. 
These developments were reflected in the reports by  sell-side analysts, who adjusted their models and 
share price targets accordingly. Th e average target price was €48.95 (as of the end of December 2023) 
compared to €77.30 a year earlier. Of the 22 analys t recommendations at the end of the year, eight were 
positive, thirteen were neutral and one was negative.

Board of Management and Supervis ory Board will therefore propose a dividend of €0.11 per share for 
2023 (2022: €2.40). The dividend proposal will help the company to reduce debt and, in turn, interest 
expense and improve its free cash fl ow situation. The dividend corresponds to 1.7% of 2023 core EPS 
(2022: 30%). Based on the Bayer share price at the end of 2023, the dividend yield is 0.3% (2022: 5.0%).

Maintaining intensive investor relations activities  
In 2023, our investor relations activities again focuse d on making sure capital market participants were 
kept continuously up to date on the latest developments at our company, the progress of our innovations and the business performance of our three divisions. 
Bayer management and the Investor Relations team continued to maintain their intensive dialogue with 
analysts and investors in 2023. As usual, this incl uded numerous investor co nferences and roadshows. 
Our capital-market communications largely centered ar ound the change in CEO and the resulting effects 
on our company strategy, as well as updates on our latest innovations. This continuous dialogue with analysts and investors is an important way for us to  receive their input and feedback. In total, Investor 
Relations participated in more than 500 engagements in 2023, both in person and in virtual settings.  
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 To our Stockholders
Investor Information 23
In June, we held a Crop Science Innovation Su mmit in New York and a Pharmaceuticals R&D Day in 
Boston. During these events, we provided strategy updates on our research an d development activities 
and shared insights into our innovation progress and ambitions.  
We also held our 2023 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting in a virtual setting based on the new legislation, with 
stockholders essentially afforded the same rights as  during an in-person Annual Stockholders’ Meeting. 
This new format enabled direct dialogue with stoc kholders during the even t via video communication. 
In particular, shareholders had the right to submit motions and election proposals during the virtual Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, as well as to speak. In addition, shareholders had the right to ask questions and obtain feedback during the event. Prior to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, stockholders were also able to submit written statements via the Stockholders’ Portal. 
Based on our positive experience last year, we will ho ld our 2024 Annual Stockholde rs’ Meeting in a virtual 
setting, too. Stockholders will have the same rights as they had at last year’s event.  
Sustainability: intensive dialogue with investors and ESG rating agencies 
We again engaged in numerous conver sations with investors regarding su stainability issues  in 2023, with 
climate protection, biodiversity, access to medicine an d the environmental impact of our products among 
the focal topics once more. 
In addition to bilateral investor conversations, con ferences and roadshows, we also hosted two webinars 
during which we provided informatio n on current topics. Here, we feel it  is important to bring in experts 
from the divisions and central func tions as this helps give capital market participants a deeper 
understanding of the various topics while also prov iding a direct channel for investors to communicate 
their needs to the company. 
With respect to the ESG ratings, our biggest accomplis hment was being upgraded to “Prime” by ISS ESG. 
Overall, we have a good performance rating prof ile that reflects our ongo ing transparency efforts. 
However, we continue to see room for improvement as regards certain ESG ratings on controversial 
issues, with occasional unfavorable ratings fo r topics such as glyphosate and GMOs.  
Success on the bond markets for Bayer – total issue volume exceeding €10 billion 
Central banks continued to maintain their restrictive monetary policy in 2023 as inflation rates remained 
high. The deposit facility rate of the European Central Bank rose from 2% to 4% over the course of the year, while the Federal Reserve hiked the US federal f unds rate by a further 100 basis points to a range of 
5.25% to 5.50%. As a result, long-term interest rates also remained at a high level, and in some cases 
even continued to rise. 
Furthermore, uncertainty among market participants declined significantly compared with 2022. The 
predicted natural gas shortages in Europe had a mu ch less significant impact  on European economic 
output than initially assumed. Th e most important economic data in Europe and the United States was 
encouraging throughout the year despite high interest rates, an d there were also some particularly 
promising signals from the unemployment figures. Al though Russia continued its war in Ukraine, the 
conflict did not escalate to a global level as had been  feared. All of these factors led to a tightening of 
credit spreads in 2023, and only the insolvency of two smaller US banks and Credit Suisse in spring 2023 
caused a brief opposing effect.

Investor Information 24
The interest rate environment in combination with rebounding confidence among market participants 
resulted in a productive 2023 on the bond markets. After plummeting in 2022, absolute issue volumes for 
corporate bonds returned to 2021 levels. Bayer was among the companies looking to capitalize on the positive market environment, and in 2023 placed three separate bonds with a total volume in excess of 
€10 billion. 
A €3 billion bond was placed on the euro market in Ma y 2023, split into three tr anches with maturities 
of 3.25, 6.25 and 10 years. Before issuing the bond, we held a roadshow that attracted a great deal of interest among investors, ultimately resultin g in a heavily oversubscribed order book.  
A new hybrid bond with a volume of €1.75 billion was issued in September 2023 , split into two tranches 
with noncall periods of 5.25 years and 8.25 years. The objective of th e issuance was to facilitate the early 
partial refinancing of the €1.5 b illion hybrid bond with an optional  call date in 2024 and the €1 billion 
hybrid bond with an optional call date in 2025. In  parallel with the new issu ance, we offered existing 
investors the option of early rede mption for these two hybrid bonds.  The tender offer was accepted by 
investors representing approximatel y €1.4 billion of the nominal volume, enabling us to sign ificantly lower 
our refinancing costs. 
In November 2023, we issued a US $5.75 billion bond on the US market . The volume was split over five 
tranches with maturities of three, ju st over five, seven, ten and thirty years. As Bayer had not been present 
on the US market since 2018, we held a two-day virt ual roadshow ahead of the issuance that attracted a 
huge amount of interest among investors in that country. The company plans to mainly use the proceeds 
to repay financial liabilities due in 2024. 
Furthermore, bonds with a total volu me of US$3.5 billion and €500 million were redeemed over the course 
of the year.

About this Report 
This integrated Annual Report combin es our financial reporting and mate rial sustainability information.  
Our aim is to elucidate the interactions between fina ncial, ecological and societal factors and underline 
their influence on our company’s long-term success. All information required by commercial law is 
combined and referenced in our nonfin ancial statement. In addition to  the Annual Report, we publish a 
separate Sustainability Report with additional detailed nonfinancial info rmation to meet the informational 
needs of all stakeholders to the greatest possible extent. 
Legal principles and reporting standards 
The consolidated financial statements of the Baye r Group as of December 31, 2023, comply with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, valid at the closing date and with the provisions of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with German financial reporting standards (DRS). With due regard to these provisions, the Combined Management Report provides an 
accurate overview of the financial po sition and results of operations of the Bayer Grou p. The Corporate 
Governance Report also conforms with the German Stock Corporation Act and the recommendations of 
the German Corporate Governance Code.  
The nonfinancial statement (Sections  289b et seq. and 315b et seq.  of the German Commercial Code) 
is integrated into the Combined Management Report and covers data for the Bayer Group and Bayer AG 
as the parent company. As a framework for this, we apply the GRI Standards (Section 289d of the 
German Commercial Code). We also use, for exampl e, the international recommendations and guidelines 
of the OECD and ISO 26000 as a guide for defining  and selecting nonfinanci al indicators and in our 
reporting. When selecting and measuring our key data, we take into account the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and those of the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and 
the European Chemical Industry Co uncil with respect to other nonfinancial indicators. The legality, 
accuracy and expediency of the nonf inancial statement have been veri fied by the Supervisory Board. 
The Annual Report is available online as a PDF. Furthermore, contents subject to the statutory disclosure 
requirement are published in the Federal Gazette under consideration of the specifications of the European 
Single Electronic Format (ESEF) Regulation. 
Data collection and reporting thresholds 
In accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held  for Sale and Discontinued Operations), financial 
indicators are given for continuing operations unless oth erwise explicitly indicated. The same logic applies 
principally to HR, procurement and HSE (health, safet y and environment) inform ation and to our social 
data.

1.2 Strategy and Management 
Radical realignment of operating model to focus on our mission  
“Health for all, Hunger for none”, improve our performance and boost growth  
Ambitious sustainability targets for the entire Group 
1.2.1 Strategy and Targets  
Group strategy 
A growing and aging world population and the increasing strain on nature’s ecosystems are among the 
major challenges facing humanity. As one of the worl d’s leading companies in th e fields of health and 
nutrition, we can play a key role in devisi ng solutions to tackle these challenges. 
To support our endeavors in this regard, we primarily rely on innovations – not only to develop new 
products and solutions, but also to drive the digitalization of our business processes. We are active in 
regulated and highly profitable busine sses that are driven by innovation and in which we have the objective 
to grow ahead of the competition. At the same time, we are also working on optimizing our resource allocation and cost base. Growth an d sustainability go hand in hand; our business activities have the 
potential to make a significant contribution to achie ving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). We also pursue resolute, science-ba sed climate action along our entire value chain. 
Our strategy is subject to regular review to ensure adjustments can be made to reflect changes that arise 
across the economic and political land scape. We are currently working on a radical realignment of our 
operating model as a top priority. This new model, which we call Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO), is 
designed to put patients, farmers and consumers fr ont and center, while also  accelerating the pace of 
innovation and unlocking the potent ial of each and every employee.  
The DSO model envisages that our employees work in small, self-managed teams that are focused on a 
customer or a product. Activities are prioritized on  the basis of their contribution to the mission, and 
progress is measured in short, 90-day cycles, giving us  much greater agility. It al so enables us to eliminate 
coordination work and reduce management layers. 
Strategies of the divisions 
Crop Science The landscape is changing in agri culture: Increased pressures due to climate change combined with a 
growing population have created a pivotal moment in how our customers provide food, fuel and textile fibers for a world that needs to lear n to live within planetary boundarie s. These challenges have spurred 
rapid, disruptive changes in the industry, changing competition acr oss the value chain, creating new 
players and opening up ne w sales opportunities.  
In this dynamic environment, the speed and scale of innovation and a focus on sustainable results for our 
customers are crucial factors for su ccess. With our innovation pipeline across Seeds & Traits, Crop 
Protection and Digital Farming, a deep digital eco system, a global footpr int and a multitude of 
partnerships, we are in close proxim ity to our customers and very well po sitioned moving forward, with a 
clear focus on new, sustainable business models. We develop intelligent and integrated approaches for 
our customers, such as our Pr eceon™ Smart Corn System, our ne xt-generation herbicide-tolerant 
soybean varieties, wheat hybrids, direct-seeded rice (DSR ), biotechnology traits fo r corn in Africa and Asia, 
and carbon farming. An additional concept we are involved in is CoverCress™ for biofuels, which 
encompasses an oilseed for biofuels that of fers cover-crop benefits for the ecosystem. 
Combining our portfolio with digita l insights increases the efficacy of our products and the benefits for 
farmers, as is the case with our Climate FieldView™ digi tal software platform, for example. In addition, we 
generate value in the business-to-business area through a variety of digital platforms (e.g., our partnership 
with Microsoft). Our digital developments accelerat e innovation, drive process automation and increase 
R&D pipeline productivity. 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.2 Strategy and Management 32
Our mission is to transform the agricu ltural sector at scale on the basi s of regenerative farming and to 
create a more sustainable food production system. Fo r us, regenerative agriculture is an outcome-based 
production model based on two key building blocks: productivity, which focuses on helping farms to produce more with less; and regeneration, which focu ses on delivering a positive impact on nature. Our 
central objectives are to increase ag ricultural yields and thereby im prove the economic and social well-
being of farmers, while at the same time ensuring a positive impact on the environment, for example by 
improving soil health, reducing greenhouse gas emissi ons and increasing carbon sequestration to halt the 
advance of climate change, protecting and promoting  biodiversity, and conser ving water resources. 
As part of our commitment to sustainable agriculture,  we are pursuing ambitiou s sustainability targets for 
2030. We aim to enable our farming customers to reduce their on-field gree nhouse gas emissions per 
mass unit of crop produced by 30% compared to the overall base year emission intensity
1. This applies to 
the highest greenhouse gas-emitting crop systems in the regions Bayer serves with its products.2 We also 
aim to reduce the environmental impact of our global cr op protection portfolio pe r hectare by 30% against 
a 2014-2018 average baseline. Furthermore, we are wo rking to support 100 million smallholder farmers in 
low- and middle-income countries by improving their access to agricu ltural products, services and 
partnerships, and we are targeting a 25% reduction in water use per kilogram of rice crop by transforming 
rice-cropping systems for our smallholder customers in the relevant regions where we operate, starting in 
India3. 
Pharmaceuticals 
Driven by an aging population, the incidence of chronic diseases is on  the rise, and an increasing number 
of patients are suffering from multiple conditions affecti ng their quality of life. Scientific breakthroughs in 
fields such as cell and gene therap y and precision medicine have the po tential to cure patients with the 
highest unmet needs or even prevent diseases in the first place. In this  regard, the pharmaceuticals market 
offers significant opportunities. At the same time, we also see risks arising from the global pressure on 
pricing coupled with rising costs an d increased pressure to deliver value.  We have therefore defined clear 
strategic priorities: maximizing the operational performance of our marketed products and renewing our topline with successful launches and advances in ou r late-stage research an d development pipeline. 
We are concentrating on leveraging our current portfolio to its fullest  potential, while simultaneously 
renewing our topline by building on three new medicines with significant sales potential. Two of them – 
Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™ – are already on the market. The third compound, elinzanetant, is making good 
progress in our late-stage R&D pipelin e. In addition, we will continue investigating the active ingredient 
asundexian in a study, and are currently reevaluating  additional indications in patients in need of 
antithrombotic treatment. We are th erefore focusing our marketing an d R&D resources on ensuring the 
success of these strategic products. Furthermore, we own the full global marketing rights for the above-
mentioned products. In line with this approach, we  are investing to furthe r grow and build our US 
business.  
To safeguard long-term growth, we are continuing to invest in R&D as part of our focused strategy to 
deliver an innovative, differentiated and sustaina ble pipeline. We are con centrating on Oncology, 
Cardiovascular (including cardiov ascular precision medicine, nephro logy and acute care), Neurology & 
Rare Diseases and Immunology as therapeutic areas with  high potential in terms of impact and value. We 
continuously strive to improve our R&D producti vity. Our key measures are centered around R&D 
excellence, an operating model focu sed on our development products, dynamic resource allocation, data

1.2 Strategy and Management 33
In addition to strengthenin g our internal R&D capabilities, we are continuing to invest in our platform 
companies. BlueRock Therapeutics  LP, United States, and Asklepio s BioPharmaceutical, Inc. (AskBio), 
United States, are workin g steadily on developing breakthrough th erapies in cell and gene therapies. 
Vividion Therapeutics, Inc., United States, is stren gthening our discovery capabilit ies above all in Oncology 
and Immunology. Moreover, we are expanding our effo rts to access external innova tion through research 
collaborations and in-licensing, capturing continued growth opportunities in biologics and novel technologies.  
Making medicines accessible is key to our sustainab ility agenda. Another focus is on improving women’s 
health and strengthening their ro le in society by helping to pr omote gender equality and women’s 
economic participation. As part of this endeavor, we are levera ging our leading position in women’s 
healthcare (by sales) to help prov ide 100 million women in low- and middle-income countries with access 
to modern contraception yearly by 20 30. Our partnerships with organiza tions such as UNFPA, USAID, the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Red Cross, as  well as digital partnerships with Your Life, Life 
Yangu, UNFPA India and Zuri Health, support this  goal. In addition, we are committed to combating 
neglected tropical diseases an d noncommunicable diseases.  
Consumer Health 
Rising healthcare costs, changing demographics and increasing health aw areness among consumers 
continue to fuel attractive long -term growth in the co nsumer healthcare market. A more prominent 
consumer focus on self-care, prev ention and convenience further sh arpened during the pandemic is 
expected to continue to drive growth across all core  Consumer Health categor ies and accelerate channel 
shifts toward e-commerce.  
We provide consumers with products, services and information that empower them to improve their 
everyday health. Our strategy focuse s on growing our brands in core Co nsumer Health categories, as well 
as the transition of prescription medicines to nonpre scription status. Our profitab le growth is driven by 
strong, science-based innovation with our trusted br ands as well as new product launches. We are also 
continuously driving cost and cash produc tivity across the entire value chain.  
We continue to accelerate our digital transforma tion efforts across all ar eas of our operations, 
in marketing, sales, supply chain and R&D, to im prove engagement with consumers, customers and 
healthcare professionals while drivin g productivity, flexibility and res ilience across our value chain. We 
leverage an agile innovation model and collaborate with external partners to provide consumers with 
innovative solutions that best address their everyday  health needs. Through acquisitions and partnerships, 
we have gained access to new business models and cap abilities to provide person alized diagnostics and 
treatment solutions.  
We pursue ambitious sustainability targets. By 2030, we aim to expand  access to self-care for 100 million 
people in economically or medically  underserved communities. We are ex ecuting this ambition by fully 
embedding sustainability across our operations to offer so lutions that best serve consumers, in particular 
those for whom self-care is the primary form of care. 
Climate action and decarbonization 
Climate change impacts us all and poses one of the gr eatest challenges for the future of humankind. We 
support the Paris Agreement and its objective of limit ing global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels. Bayer’s Climate Program is built on three pillars: 
// Reducing our own emissions:  Decarbonization is a top priority for us and we are committed to reducing 
the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as sociated with our products. We have set ourselves the goal of 
achieving net zero GHG emissions (including across our entire value chain) by 2050 or earlier. The 
targets we pursue as part of our decarbonization program have been confirmed by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi). The first step is to reduce our emissions by more than 42% by the end of 2029 compared with the 2019 baseline. This will involv e a variety of measures, such as switching to 
renewable sources for 100% of the electricity we purchase.  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.2 Strategy and Management 34
// Transforming our product portfolio and leveraging new business models:  The adjustments and 
changes that climate change will bring for our business fields are embedded in our strategies and 
processes. We intend to mitigate the risks and cap italize on the opportunities. To achieve this, we 
continuously analyze the impact of  climate change on our own busine ss operations as well as on the 
activities in our upstream and down stream value chain. We publish our Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report  each year to increase transparen cy. As a science-based company, 
we place particular emphasis on our inno vation capabilities in all divisions.  
 
// Reducing emissions within and outside our value chain:  We are also cooperating with our suppliers and 
customers to reduce GHG emissions along the upst ream and downstream value chain by at least 
12.3% by 2029 compared with the 2019 baseline. We additionally aim to reduce emissions outside our value chain by 2030, helping to achieve global climat e targets. This involves our company purchasing 
certificates from certified climate pr otection projects that satisfy externa lly recognized quality standards. 
Alongside these commitments, our Crop Science Divisio n is delivering innovations to strengthen climate 
resilience, with further significan t contributions being made in the value chains of the agricultural 
industry. 
Nonfinancial Group targets 
To advance and measure the implementa tion of our strategy, we have set nonfinancial Group targets.

emissions in the following categories: (1) purchased goods and services, (2) capital goods, (3) fuel- and energy-related activi ties, (4) (upstream) 
transportation and distribution, and (6) business travel. 
8 Values for 2022 were updated due to new findings in category 3.1.

In our Crop Science  Division, we support smallholder farmers by supplying high-quality seeds and crop 
protection products, technologies and services. In 2023,  together with the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation, the Bayer Foundation continued to support Mercy Corps AgriFin’s Digital Farmer II program, 
for example. The program is aime d at providing smallholder farmers  in Africa with access to digital 
offerings, such as information and financial products and services, th rough 2025. In 2023, we supported 
53 million smallholder farmers (20 22: 52 million) in low- and middl e-income countries. Due to the 
divestment of the Environmental Science Profe ssional business in October 2022, the number of 
smallholder farmers no longer contains the respec tive Vector Control reach from 2023 onwards. 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.2 Strategy and Management 35
In our Pharmaceuticals  Division, our sales activities for modern  contraception are su pporting global aid 
programs (such as the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA), for which we offer our products on 
favorable terms. Alongside product sales, we are also engaged in partnerships like “The Challenge 
Initiative” with the Gates Institute at Johns Hopkin s University. The partnership programs we support 
help numerous women in Asia and Africa gain access to modern contraception, irrespective of the method 
or manufacturer. In 2023, we were able to incr ease the number of women reached to 46 million (2022: 
44 million).   
In our Consumer Health  Division, we advance access to everyday  health for people in underserved 
communities. We leverage our global brands and part nerships to develop and adap t self-care solutions for 
low-income consumers, bring target ed health education to communiti es who need it most, establish 
critical distribution channels, and advocate glob ally for science-based an d accessible self-care. Our 
signature program, the Nutrient Gap Initiative, aims to tackle malnutrition brought about by widespread 
micronutrient deficiency in underse rved communities around the globe,  preventing irreversible health 
damage and breaking the cycle of po verty. Through our global partnership with Vitamin Angels, we focus 
on underserved pregnant women and their babies wh o are particularly vulnerable, improving access to 
micronutrients for 4 million mothers and babies glob ally every year. Through all our direct efforts and 
partnerships, we reached 51 million people in 2023 (20 22: 49 million), and an additional 23 million in India. 
Bayer was ranked #1 in Nutrition in the 2023 Food and Agriculture Benchmark which assessed 350 of the 
most influential food and agri culture companies around the wo rld, up from #23 in 2021. 
As part of our climate strategy , we reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 0.03 million 
metric tons of CO 2 equivalents (–0.9%) year on year in 2023, mainly  due to a greater share of electricity 
being purchased from renewable energy sources. In the Scope 3 Science Based Targets (SBT) categories 
that are relevant for our company, our em issions fell by 0.54 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents, 
representing a decrease of 6.0% compared with 2022.  The fall in Scope 3 emissions in the SBT-relevant 
Scope 3 categories was largely attributable to re duced purchasing volumes (Scope 3.1) and the 
associated logistics operations (Scope 3.4).  
In addition, we offset 0.6 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents through external projects to achieve 
carbon neutrality at our own sites.  
1.2.2 Management Systems 
Planning and steering 
Economic planning and steering are conducted in line with the frameworks that are set for the Group and 
the divisions by the Board of Management in the co urse of the strategic planning process, and are 
translated into specific targets du ring operational planning. The planning and steering process is 
complemented by the continuous monitoring of business developments, with key financial and nonfinancial management and performance indi cators being updated regularly. 
The following financial and nonfinancial indicator s were employed to plan, steer and monitor the 
development of our business: 
Operational management indicators 
The main parameters in performance management at the operational level are sales growth, earnings and 
cash flow data, which also form the basis of short-te rm variable compensation (STI). Sales growth is 
measured in terms of the change in sales after adju sting for currency and portfolio effects (Fx & portfolio 
adj.) in order to reflect the operational business development of the Group and the divisions. A key 
measure of profitability is the EBIT DA margin before special items, which is the ratio of EBITDA before 
special items to sales. Another impo rtant profitability indicator for the Bayer Group is core earnings per 
share, which is the core net income divided by th e weighted average number of shares. Free cash flow – 
an absolute indicator – shows the ge neration of freely available financial resources and also reflects the 
company’s financial strength and earning power. 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.3 Focus on Innovation 36
Strategic value management indicator: ROCE 
Return on capital employed (ROCE) is used as a strategic metric to measure the company’s operating 
profit after taxes in relation to the average capit al employed. Comparing RO CE against the weighted 
average cost of capital (WA CC) on an annual basis illustrates the leve l of value creation. It also forms part 
of our long-term stock-based cash compensation (LTI). 
Total shareholder return 
We aim to create shareholder value and thus deliver attractive returns for our stockholders. Total shareholder return, which is determined based on th e change in the share price over the measurement 
period plus any dividends paid in the interim, also forms part of our long-term stock-based cash 
compensation (LTI). 
Sustainability 
We aim to improve people’s lives through our products. At the same time, we also endeavor to reduce our 
ecological footprint. We regulate and measure the attain ment of our sustainability targets with the aid of 
nonfinancial key performance indica tors (KPIs). We take into account th e number of people reached in the 
“100 million” divisional targets and our greenhouse gas emissions as indi cators for tracking the sustainable 
steering of our business and the redu ction of our ecological footprint (see A 1.2.1/1). Our sustainability 
KPIs are also reflected in our long-term stock-based cash compensation (LTI) program. 
Integrated management system 
We maintain a Group-wide integrated management syst em (IMS), which is detailed in a corporate policy. 
The IMS provides a framework for a ll management systems at Bayer, ensuring compliance with the law 
and with internal and external requir ements while also ensuring efficient ways of working. This is achieved 
through internal regulations and a pplicable processes involving clear roles and responsibilities. The IMS 
therefore plays a key role in safeguard ing our company’s license to operate. 
1.3 Focus on Innovation 
We create value for customers and so ciety by offering new solutions. Our activities focus on innovative 
products based on our research and developm ent (R&D) competencies, supplemented by new 
approaches in our process, servi ce and business models. We are also committed to social innovation to 
improve living conditions for people in developing countries and disadvan taged individuals in our society. 
The results of our research and development help us contribute to solving global challenges in medical 
care and agriculture. In addition to the strong innovative capabilitie s of our employees throughout the 
company, our efforts are driven by a broad open innovation network an d the use of new, groundbreaking 
technologies with a particular focus on data science insights. 
Partnerships are integral to our innovation strategy , ensuring access to complementary technologies and 
expertise. We enter into strategic alliances with va rious partners such as universities, governmental 
agencies, startups, suppliers an d other industrial companies. 
We maintain a global network of R&D locations where around 16,800 Bayer employees work. In 2023, our 
research and development spend before special item s amounted to €5,835 millio n (2022: €6,168 million).

1.3 Focus on Innovation 37
Excellence in research and development 
The activities we pursue are aligned with the innovati on strategies of our divisions, and are aimed at 
improving human and plant health and sustainably safeguarding stable harv ests in agriculture in line with 
our mission “Health for all, Hunger for none.” 
We are increasingly employing data science methods in the R&D projects of our three divisions. In 
addition, our “Life Science Collaboration” program pr ovides a platform that enables our employees to 
actively promote disruptive innovations on a cross-divisional basis. 
At Crop Science, we are driving forward the development of innovative products and services tailored to 
farmers’ individual needs. We incr easingly offer our customers comprehe nsive and novel systems solutions 
to drive long-term growth. With our investments in research and development, we have developed cutting-
edge technologies and innovations which are designed  to increase our customers’ productivity and thus 
enhance food security, and help farmers further redu ce the environmental cost of agriculture. Some of 
these innovations were presented to the public in 2023 at the inaugural Crop Science Innovation Summit, with the concept of regenerative agriculture taking cen ter stage. We offer a range of products and services 
to promote this approach to farming, such as our shor t-stature corn, the Climat e FieldView™ integrated 
digital platform and our carbon farming  activities, which enable farmers to sequester carbon in soil. Our 
crop protection innovations enable us to set new in dustry standards with su stainable solutions and 
develop a new generation of crop protection products  through the CropKey appr oach. The focus here is 
on new mechanisms of action and selecting the best te chnological solutions, with safety and sustainability 
aspects being taken into consideration right from the beginning. Our wholly owned subsidiary Targenomix makes an important contribution in this regard by leveraging its leading know-how in the area of systems biology. In 2023, we began the construction of a building complex at the Monheim site in Germany that 
includes laboratories, offices and a greenhouse area. This €220 million investment will go toward helping 
make crop protection products safer for people, an imals and the environment.  We aim to increase our 
market potential by tapping into new, adjacent markets.  To achieve this goal, we are increasingly focusing 
on partnerships. Our collaboration with Kimitec Socied ad Limitada, Spain, in the area of biologicals is one 
such example. 
Our Pharmaceuticals Division focuses on four core ar eas: Oncology, Cardiovascular, Neurology & Rare 
Diseases, and Immunology. This appr oach is designed to translate higher innovation quality and 
productivity into long-term growth. Our subsidiary Vividion Therapeutics  Inc., United States, reached a key 
milestone for its innovative chemoproteomics technology platform by initiating a Ph ase I trial with a highly 
specific, potent Kelch-like ECH Associated Protein 1 (K EAP1) activator for the treatment of advanced solid 
tumors. This is the first clinical can didate in its class for cancer trea tment. We are investing US$250 million 
in a new cell therapy manufacturing facility in Berkeley , California, United States, that will supply cell 
therapy products for addition al clinical trials and future product launches. In 2023, we also announced a 
partnership with Twist Bioscience Corporation, Un ited States, to accelerat e drug discovery. The 
collaboration gives us access to a library of synthetic antibodies that are to be investigated in various 
indications. Furthermore, we have inaugurated the “Bayer Co.Lab” incubator in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, United States. The in cubator focuses on cell and gene th erapy startups with the aim of 
accelerating innovation and fostering collaborations within vibrant biotec h ecosystems. Co-located with the 
Bayer Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), it cr eates an interdisciplinary community for startups.  
In 2023, the Consumer Health Division launched a business unit focused on developing new precision 
health products across its range of everyday health categories. We are already active in the precision 
health space. Together with our part ner Ada Health GmbH, Germany, we have conducted a variety of pilot 
projects since 2021 to embed Ada’s AI-based symptom assessment into several product groups. We are 
supporting a new diagnosis methodology for heart di sease with an innovati ve cardiovascular risk 
assessment tool powered by Huma Therapeutics Limite d, United Kingdom. The risk assessment is 100% 
digital and does not require users to submit a bl ood sample or undergo a physical examination. 
The Bayer Bioethics Council, an ex ternal advisory body which was established at the end of 2021, 
convened twice in 2023 to discuss to pics such as secondary use of clinical data and generative AI. The 
Bayer Science Collaboration Explorer transparency  initiative was expanded in 2023 and published 
information on contract-based collaborations between Bayer business units in Germany, the United States 
and Switzerland and global partners.

The Leaps by Bayer portfolio comprise d more than 50 active investments in biotech and tech startups at 
the end of 2023. 
Examples of the wide-ranging activities in the fiel d of healthcare in 2023 incl uded the development of 
innovative therapeutic a pproaches to treat cancer and genetic diseases.  
In connection with the focus on “Prevent and cure cancer,” Leaps co -led a financing round at the 
beginning of the year for NextPoint Therapeutics , United States, a biotech firm engaged in the 
development of novel monotherapies in immuno-oncolog y. Leaps also invested in Boundless Bio, Inc., 
United States, a next-gen eration precision oncology  company that develops innovative therapeutics 
directed against extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) fo r patients with oncogene amplified cancers. 
Furthermore, Leaps participated in a financing round for Paratus Sciences Corpor ation, United States, a 
company which is seeking to develop new therapies for some of the most challeng ing health issues facing 
humanity. The objectives are to control inflammation, tolerate viral infections and resist cancer. 2023 also 
saw Leaps invest in 65LAB, a newly established incuba tor based in Singapore. It marks the first time 
Leaps has invested in Asia. 65LAB aims to advance dr ug discovery and the creation of new therapeutics 
companies by investing in research groups that are seeking to achieve  fundamental breakthroughs in the 
biosciences.  
An additional milestone was the a nnouncement of positive results from  a clinical Phase I trial in the 
treatment of Parkinson’s disease conducted by Blue Rock Therapeutics LLP, Un ited States. BlueRock 
Therapeutics is a wholly owned, independently operat ed subsidiary of Bayer AG. In addition, Asklepsios 
BioPharmaceutical, Inc. (AskBio), Unit ed States, a wholly owned and inde pendently operated subsidiary of 
Bayer AG, and the Leaps portfolio company ReCode Therapeutics, Inc ., United States , announced the 
signing of a collaboration agreement, marking a miles tone in gene therapy resear ch and development. The 
agreement sees the two companies working together to develop medicines using a single-vector gene editing platform.  
In the area of agriculture, Leaps pa rticipated in a financing round for ChrysaLabs Inc., Canada, a startup 
which combines AI with a sampling probe in order to provide real-time measur ements of soil nutrients, 
delivering findings faster and more co st-effectively than is po ssible with conventional methods. In addition, 
the Crop Science Division announced  a new collaboration with Oerth Bio LLC, United States, a company 
already listed in the Leaps portfolio, at the beginning  of the year. The new collaboration is aimed at 
developing environmentally friendly  crop protection products using Oerth’s PROTAC™ protein degradation 
technology. Furthermore, the Leaps po rtfolio company Pairwise Plants LLC , United States, entered into a 
new five-year cooperation agreement with the Crop Science Division to jointly optimize gene-edited short-stature corn.

Patents protect Bayer’s intellectual property 
Reliable global protection of intellectua l property rights is particularly important for an innovation company 
like Bayer. In most cases, it would be impossible to cover the high cost s and risks incurred in the research 
and development of innovative products without this protection. We are therefore committed worldwide to protecting both the international patent system and our own intellectual property. Depending on the legal framework, we endeavor to obtain patent protection for our products and technologies in major markets. 
When we successfully market patent-protected products , we are able to invest the profits sustainably in 
research and development. 
The term of a patent is normally 20 years from the date the application is filed. Since it takes an average of 
11 to 13 years to develop a new medicine or crop protection active ingredient, only seven to nine years of patent protection remain following the product’s approval. The same applies to the development of new 
transgenic traits. To nevertheless provide an adequate  incentive to make the necessary major investments 
in research and development, the European Union member states, the United  States, Japan and some 
other countries extend patent terms or issue supplem entary protection certificates  to compensate for the 
shortening of the effective protection period for pharm aceutical and crop protection patents, but not for 
transgenic traits. 
Crop Science 
Working with digital applications and teams of expert s, we develop a broad spectrum of tailored solutions 
that enable farmers to achieve higher productivi ty in a sustainable manner. Our R&D organization 
comprises approximately 8,300 employees (2022: 7,700)4 operating in more than 60 countries around the 
world. We also collaborate with ma ny external partners under our Open Innovation model to strengthen 
our innovation power.  
Research and development capacities Our R&D is focused on developing solutions for farmers and customers across multiple indications. Using 
a targeted approach, we focus on bringing together our expertise across the following disciplines to deliver 
innovation faster. 
Our 
breeding  innovations are aimed at improving crop yiel ds, boosting resiliency against pests, disease 
and a changing climate, and improv ing quality. We combine genomic, phenotypic and environmental data 
with the use of advanced breeding methods and AI to develop novel seed products. Advances in 
controlled-environment greenhouses, automated and prescriptive seed packaging systems, and advanced 
field data collection systems enable us to accelerate the development and positioning of seed products for 
our largest markets. Through our ad vanced breeding program, we were able to deploy more than 400 new 
hybrid and varietal seed products in 2023, across corn, soybeans, cotton , oilseed rape/canola, rice, wheat 
and vegetables. 
Biotechnology  and genome editing  tools allow us to develop traits in crops like corn, soybeans, cotton 
and canola that strengthen plants’ resistance to insect pests, di sease, weeds and other environmental 
stresses such as drought or high wi nds, protecting or enhancing yields . Biotechnology enables sustainable 
farming with reduced pesticide use an d conservative tillage practices th at are designed to preserve topsoil 
and decrease CO 2 emissions. We are the global leader in pl ant biotechnology and ha ve 12 next-generation 
traits in development.  
In our small molecule chemistry  program, we design, develop and op timize new, safe and sustainable 
crop protection products with herbic idal, insecticidal and fungicidal act ivity. We are working on tailored 
solutions that will help farmers achieve better harves ts by managing threats in a more targeted manner. 
With hundreds of new Crop Protection product regist rations annually, our life-cycle management program 
allows us to extend the reach of our products into new crops and geographies. Discovering new modes of 
action (MOAs) is one of the priorities of our new CropKey approach, contributing to finding improved solutions for our customers’ needs and achieving our sustainability targ ets, with a particular focus on 
reducing the environmental im pact of crop protection.

New products and registrations in 2023 (examples) 
ThryvOn™ Technology  stacked with Bollgard™ 3 XtendFlex™ T echnology was launched commercially in 
the United States to provide a br oad spectrum of insect protection, and more options against tough-to-
control and resistant weeds like Palm er amaranth, waterhemp and marestail.  
Iblon™,  a new broad-spectrum fungicide, received UK  regulatory approval in 2023 and will be 
commercially launched for 2024. It is designed to de liver comprehensive fungicidal activity against the 
main foliar diseases in wheat.  
Curbix™ Pro, an innovation in pest management technology for rice paddy production, has been launched 
in India. This combination of two complementary mo des of action can be used against hard-to-control 
plant hoppers, is effective against all in stars and provides long -lasting control of the brown planthopper.  
We continued the expansion of the  Preceon™ Smart Corn System  testing in 2023 through the Ground 
Breakers™ Field Trials to approximately 30,000 acres an d nearly 300 farms. This test and learn approach 
will be essential for enhancing the system in the future . We expect to have a targ eted introduction in the 
United States in 2024.  
Our direct-seeded rice (DSR) system, which provides an alternative to  traditional rice production, was 
introduced in 2023. Moving from transplanted puddl ed rice cultivation to direct-seeded rice can help 
farmers reduce water use by up to 40%, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by up to 45% and reduce farmers’ dependence on scarce and cost ly manual labor by up to 50%. By 2030, we plan to bring the DSR 
system to one million hectar es in India, supporting over two millio n early-adopter smallholder rice farmers 
through our DirectAcres program.  
Following a successful pre-launch in Paraguay and Brazil for 2022, we have commercially launched our 
new fungicide Fox™ Supra, provid ing growers with a new active ingr edient, Indiflin™, to defend their 
harvests and strengthening our leading position in this market segment. Fox™ Supra offers two complementary modes of action, prov iding control of Asian soybean ru st, and will complement our broad-
spectrum solution Fox™ Xpro in s easonal spray campaigns, helping farmers achieve higher yields. 
In the United States, Velum™ Rise was launched as a novel nematicide/fungicide developed specifically for 
potato growers. It combines fluopyram and penflufen  to deliver advanced protection against nematodes 
and diseases, resulting in improved yields. Building up on the trusted performance of fluopyram applied in 
furrow for true nematode control, Velum™ Rise br oadens the disease spectrum by adding penflufen, 
suppressing key soil-borne diseases like Rhizoctonia solani and black dot.

Patents 
We routinely apply for patent protection for our i nnovations in both chemical crop protection and 
seed  / biotechnology. The link between patents and products is relatively complex. Products often combine 
multiple technologies that are patent ed differently in different areas of th e world, with patents often granted 
only late in the product life cycle. 
Although the patents have already expired for some of our crop protection activ e ingredients, such as 
glyphosate, trifloxystrobi n, prothioconazole, bixafen7 or imidacloprid, we have a portfolio of patents on 
formulations, mixtures and  / or manufacturing processes for these active  ingredients. In addition, fluopyram 
is patent-protected until 20 25 in the United States  and Brazil, and there ar e supplementary protection 
certificates granted in several European countries in cluding Germany, France and the United Kingdom until 
2024. The younger active ingredient tetraniliprole has patent protection until 2029 in Germany, France, the 
United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada an d other countries, and in the United  States its patent protection 
extends until 20308. Isoflucypram is patent-prot ected in the United States unt il 2028 and in Brazil, Canada, 
Germany, France, the United King dom and other countries until 2030.9 
While our patent coverage on the first-generation Roundup Ready™ trait for soybeans has expired, some 
varieties – for example in the United States – are still protected by variety patents. The patent coverage on 
our current generation of soybean traits (Roundup  Ready 2 Xtend™, XtendFle x™ and Intacta 2 Xtend™) 
runs until at least the end of the decade.  
In corn seed and traits, most farmers have alread y upgraded to next-generat ion branded corn traits. 
SmartStax™ and SmartStax™ PRO have patent coverage  running until at least 2028. For cotton seed and 
traits, Bollgard™ 3 XtendFlex™ has patent coverage until at least the mid-2030s. 
Partnerships and collaboration 
We partner with innovators from across the world to bring the disruptive new t echnologies that farmers 
need to market more quickly and effi ciently, in collaborations that a llow us to leverage our specialized 
expertise and resources.  
Biologicals 
In January, we announced a partnership with M2i Grou p to supply fruit and vegetable growers around the 
world with pheromone-based biological crop protec tion products. Through the agreement we became the 
exclusive distributor of select M2i products based on  an original slow-release pheromones formulation. 
This easy-to-apply gel technology targets lepidoptera pests in crops that includ e stone and pome fruits, 
tomatoes and grapes, and in the futu re will also target sucking pests.  This partnership led to our first 
successful pheromone-based product launch from this range, Vynyty™ Tuta Press, which was launched in 
Spain in July. 
In February, we began a strategic biologicals pa rtnership with Kimitec fo cused on accelerating the 
development and commercialization of biological crop  protection solutions and biostimulants derived from 
natural sources. 
Gene editing 
In August, we started a new partnership with Pairwise focused on further innovations in short-stature corn. 
This new program leverages Pairwise’s Fulcrum™ platform and builds on the success of the two 
companies’ initial five-year collaboration for corn, soy, wheat, cotton and canola.  
We are part of a global network of partners from di verse segments of the agricultural industry and work 
together with numerous public-private bodies, NGOs, universities, and other institutions.

Pharmaceuticals 
Our research and development activit ies in the Pharmaceuticals Division  are focused on indications with 
a high medical need. In 2023, while maintaining ou r existing projects in ophthalmology and women’s 
healthcare, we realigned our focus to concentrate on four key areas: on cology, cardiovascular, neurology 
& rare diseases and immunology. In the context of  our cell and gene therapy platform, we develop 
treatments for indications which are likewise associated with a high medical need and in which cell and 
gene therapies could offer promising treatment opti ons, regardless of the specific therapeutic area. 
Examples of this include neurodegenerative diso rders, muscular dystrophies, cardiovascular and 
metabolic diseases, and ophthalmological disorders. Our work in radiology focuses on the development 
of digital solutions, contrast agents and injectio n systems. Approximately 7,800 (2022: 7,900) employees 
work in our R&D departments at a number of locatio ns around the world, ma inly in Germany and the 
United States. 
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.3 Focus on Innovation 44
In our R&D activities, we combine profound knowledge about disease biology with numerous therapy 
forms and focus on the systematic implementation of digital technologies and the deployment of data sciences to increase the speed, reliability and effectiven ess of our R&D processes. Our aim is to employ 
precision medicine to offer patients effective, individualiz ed solutions that prevent, diagnose, treat or stop 
diseases.  
With the acquisitions of the biotech firms BlueRock  Therapeutics, Inc., United States, in 2019 and 
Asklepios Biopharmaceutical Inc. (AskBio), United St ates, in 2020, and the bi opharmaceutical company 
Vividion Therapeutics, Inc., United States, in 2021, we have expanded  our expertise in new modalities to 
include competencies in the areas of cell therapy (BlueRock) and gene therapy (AskBio) while also 
strengthening our existing knowledge in the field of precision small-molecule therapeutics (Vividion). As 
internal partners, these three companies operate larg ely autonomously but in close cooperation with our 
research and development experts in  the Pharmaceuticals Division. They play a key role in sustainably 
expanding our research pipeline wi th novel development candidates. In  2023, the three companies further 
advanced their development portfolio and establishe d additional expertise in specific areas. Further 
information can be found in the “Cell and gene th erapy”, “Chemoproteomics” and “External innovation” 
sections. 
Promising new molecular entities from our early research pipeline are transferred to preclinical 
development. We define a new molecular entity (NME) as  an active ingredient that  is not yet approved for 
use in humans. In preclinical development, these subs tances are examined further in various models with 
respect to their suitability for clinical trials and the associated firs t-in-human studies.  
Clinical trials are an essential tool for determining the efficacy and safety of new drugs before they can be 
used to diagnose or treat diseases. The benefits an d risks of new medicinal products must always be 
scientifically proven and well document ed. All our clinical trials comply wi th strict international guidelines 
and quality standards, as well as the respecti ve applicable national laws and standards.  
Bayer also publishes information about clinical trials in line with the applicable  national laws and according 
to the principles of the European (EFPIA) and US (PhRMA) pharmaceuti cal industry associations, these 
principles being defined in position papers. 
Information about our own clinical trials can be found in the publicly accessible register 
www.ClinicalTrials.gov and our own Trial Finder data base. Further information on our globally uniform 
standards, the monitoring of studies and the role of  the ethics committees can be found on our website. 
Cell and gene therapy 
The addition of cell and gene therapies to our drug development portfolio has given us new, potentially transformative treatment approaches that could interv ene in disease mechanisms and ultimately stop or 
reverse them at some point in the future.  
Ensuring scientific breakthroughs in cell and gene th erapy translate into available treatments on a global 
scale requires a strong commitment  across the whole value chain. That ’s why we are investing in the 
know-how and infrastructure in every step of th e process, from early research and development to 
advanced production. 
Our development portfolio comprises seven projects in various stages of clinical development that cover 
several therapeutic areas with a high unmet medical need, with innovative programs in areas such as 
Parkinson’s disease, rare diseas es and congestive heart failure.

The nature of drug discovery and development is such that not all compounds can be expected to meet the predefined project goal s. It is 
possible that any or all of the projects listed above may have to be discontinued due to scientific and/or commercial reasons a nd will not result 
in commercialized products. It is also possible that the requisite US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Ag ency (EMA) or 
other regulatory approvals will not be granted for these compounds. Moreover, we regularly review our research and development pipeline so 
that we can give priority to advancing the most promising pharmaceutical projects. 
The following material developments occurred in 2023 and early 2024:  
Asundexian 
// In May, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation for our 
investigational drug asundexian as  a potential treatment to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in 
patients with atrial fibrillation. This  was the second Fast Track Designat ion for the oral Factor XIa (FXIa) 
inhibitor: The US FDA granted Fast Track Designation for the investigation of asundexian for prevention 
of stroke in patients after an isch emic stroke (non-cardioembolic isch emic stroke prevention) in January 
2022. Fast Track Designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug 
candidates to treat serious medical condit ions and address unmet medical needs.  
// In November, we decided not to initiate Phase III de velopment of asundexian in patients with an acute 
myocardial infarction.   
// Also in November, we announced the decision to st op the Phase III study, OCEANIC-AF, investigating 
asundexian compared to apixaban (a dire ct oral anticoagulant) in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for 
stroke. This decision was based on the recommendation of the study’s Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) as part of ongoing surveillance which showed asundexian 50 mg was not as effective 
as the FXa comparator in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (SPAF). 
// The IDMC recommends continuing the OCEANIC-STROKE Phase III study as planned.

Aflibercept 
// In May, we initiated the Phase III QUASAR study,  designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
aflibercept 8 mg dosed at extended treatment interv als compared to the standard of care, Eylea™ 
(aflibercept 2 mg), in macular edema seco ndary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO). 
Darolutamide 
// In March, we further expanded the global clinical  development program for darolutamide in prostate 
cancer with the new Phase III clinical study ARAST EP. This study is investigating the efficacy of 
darolutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT ) versus ADT alone in hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer in patients with high-risk biochemical recu rrence (BCR) who have no evidence of metastatic 
disease by conventional imaging and a positive PSMA PET/CT at baseline. 
Elinzanetant 
// In January 2024, we announced positive top-line resu lts of the pivotal Phase III OASIS 1 and 2 studies 
investigating the efficacy and safety of elinzanetant versus placebo in  women with vasomotor symptoms 
(VMS, also known as hot flashes) associated with menopause. Elinzanetant successfully met all four 
primary endpoints in both studies, demonstrating stat istically significant reduct ions in the frequency and 
severity of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to week 4 and 12 compared to placebo. Both studies 
also achieved all three key second ary endpoints, showing a statistica lly significant reduction in the 
frequency of VMS from baseline to week 1, as well as statistically significant improvements in sleep 
disturbances and menopause-related quality of life compared to placebo. The s afety profile observed in 
the OASIS 1 and 2 studies is overall consistent wi th previously published data on elinzanetant. 
// Likewise in January 2024, we announced the expans ion of the ongoing clini cal development program 
for elinzanetant with the start of NIRVANA, a ne w Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
elinzanetant in women with sleep disturba nces associated with menopause (SDM).  
Gadoquatrane 
// In June, we announced the start of the Phase III clinical developmen t program QUANTI with 
gadoquatrane, a next-generation gadolinium-based contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) which has the potential to enable a substantiall y lower clinical gadolinium dose for patients. The 
program aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the development candidate in contrast-enhanced 
MRI in two multinational Phase III studies and one pedi atric study across all body regions and all ages. 
Adrenomedullin Pegol 
// In May, we decided not to pursue further de velopment activities fo r the Phase II program 
Adrenomedullin Pegol (PEG-ADM), developed for the tr eatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
for scientific reasons.  
BDKRB1 receptor antagonist 
// In March, we decided not to further pursue the development of our BDKRB1 receptor antagonist based 
on the Phase IIa results in th e indication neuropathic pain.

Runcaciguat 
// In April, we decided to discontinue further develo pment of runcaciguat, a soluble guanylate cyclase 
(sGC) activator in Phase II clinical development, in the indication chronic kidney disease (CKD). We will 
continue the sGC activator/CKD development prog ram with the oral sGC activator BAY3283142, a 
follow-up compound to runcaciguat whic h shows an improved PK/PD profile 
(pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) and is currently  completing Phase I clinical development.  
Copanlisib (PI3K inhibitor) + chemotherapy combination 
// In November, following discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we decided to 
voluntarily withdraw our Aliqopa™ (copanlisib) US New Drug Application for adult patients with relapsed 
follicular lymphoma (FL). The reason for the withdrawal was th at copanlisib had not confirmed its clinical 
benefit in the CHRONOS-4 st udy requested by the FDA.

1.3 Focus on Innovation 50
In addition to the information in the table, it should be noted that in Europe our Xarelto™ 10, 15 and 
20 mg tablets are protected by a patent granted by th e European Patent Office fo r once-daily dosing until 
2026. This patent has been successfully defended at European level but is being attacked again at the 
national level in a number of countries. We are confiden t that we will be able to ward off such attacks. In 
the case of such secondary patents, there is also the risk of an attempt to circumvent them. However, we 
will take vigorous action against an y infringement of this patent. 
In the United States, our Xarelto™ 10, 15 and 20 mg tablets are also protected by a patent for once-daily 
dosing beyond 2025. There have al ready been patent law disputes that have been settled through 
settlements, including with Unichem, Inc. and Unichem Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc. (collectively 
“Unichem”). According to the settlement with Uniche m, Unichem will be licensed under the relevant 
patents to market a generic version of Xarelto™ 10, 15 and 20 mg tablets from 2027 or earlier in certain 
circumstances, which we do not expect at this time. In the United States, as in Eu rope, there is a risk of 
attempts to circumvent and attacks on this patent by previously uninvolved competitors from 2025 onwards.

1.3 Focus on Innovation 52
Consumer Health 
At Consumer Health, we concentrat e on developing new nonprescription (OTC) products and solutions 
that improve consumer health and well-being. We main tain a global network of research and development 
facilities, with major sites in the United States, Fran ce, Switzerland, United Ki ngdom, Germany and China 
at which approximately 740 employees (2022: 700 empl oyees) work. We are active in the areas of pain, 
cardiovascular risk prevention, dermatology, nutrition al supplements, digestive health, allergy and cough & 
cold.  
Our focus lies on product developments that are insight-driven and aligne d to the unmet needs of 
consumers. Our innovations range from new product de velopment, improved form ulations, digital tools, 
devices and packaging to new claims and consumer h ealth education tools. In addition, we developed 
around 50 new consumer-validated product innovation s in 2023. We are strength ening Consumer Health’s 
innovation pipeline with around 170 active projects th at we are developing across all our categories. These 
include core and adjacent innovations as well as tran sformational innovations that could significantly 
advance self-care products for consumers worldwide.10   
A further important part of our innovation strategy is transitioning current prescription medicines that are 
suitable for self-care to over-the-co unter status (Rx-to-OTC switches).  
We also introduced a number of product line extensions for existing brands in various countries in 2023, 
for example:  
In North America, we partnered with UK digital heal th company Huma Therapeutics Limited to launch the 
Bayer Aspirin Heart Risk Assessment in the US market. This online tool quickly assesses an individual’s 
risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease over  the next 10 years, and th e results can be shared 
with a healthcare professional as pa rt of ongoing health management. The digital tool was developed using 
UK Biobank data with over 450,000 participants. It only takes five minutes and does not require invasive measurements which are a barrier for patien ts to understand their heart health risk. 
In Europe/Middle East/Africa, we launched CanesFlora+ in France (“Hydralin IntimiFlor”), a probiotic food 
supplement with clinical eviden ce to support women’s intimate health. This product expands the 
Canesten™ line and enables us to fulfill consumers’ n eeds and reach wider target  groups. The probiotic 
solution serves as a vital support system in maintaining the microbiome balance and preventing recurring infections like bacterial vaginosis and thrush. 
In the Asia/Pacific region, we expanded the Elevit™ br and in China from prenatal to infant with the launch 
of two new supplements: DHA for heal thy brain and eye development, an d a probiotic powder to support 
gut health. These additions are critical  to Elevit™’s mission of delivering nut rition for the heal thiest start in 
the first 1,000 days of life.  
 
10 Core innovation means optimizing existing products for existing customers. Adjacent innovation refers to the extension of exis ting brands to 
new market segments, i.e. new products and assets are added. Transformational innovation refers to achieving breakthroughs and creating 
new markets that do not yet exist.

1.4 Commitment to Employees 53
1.4 Commitment to Employees 
Bayer’s business success is largely built on the knowledge and commitm ent of our workforce. As an 
employer, we offer our employees attractive cond itions and wide-ranging individual development 
opportunities. Alongside professional training, we focus on promoting a dialogue- and feedback-oriented 
culture based on trust, intentional inclusion, and respect for diversity and equality of opportunity, which is also summarized in our corporate policy entitled “Fairness and Re spect at Work.” Our employees 
worldwide are trained to comply wi th these guidelines. We measure th e engagement and satisfaction of 
our employees through systematic feedback discussion s and regular employee surv eys. Responsibility for 
the human resources strategy of the Bayer Group lies with the Board of Management, supported by Bayer’s Human Resources enabling function. The strategy is implemented globally within the scope of binding policies.  
For more than 10 years, Bayer’s LIFE  values (Leadership, Integrity, Flex ibility and Efficiency) have guided 
us in our activities. These stand for our values and leadership principles. Attributes define each value’s 
practical meaning and behaviors, laying the fo undation for how employees work at Bayer.  
Employees at all Bayer sites around the world have th e right to elect their own representatives. In 2023, 
the working conditions for around 52% (2022: 53%)  of our employees worldwide were governed by 
collective or company agreements. 
Employee data 
On December 31, 2023, we employed 99,723 people (2022: 101,369) worldwide. In Germany, we had 
22,172 (2022: 22,569) employees, representing 22.2% of the total Group workforce (2022: 22.3%).  
In 2023, the Bayer Group hired 9,247 new employees (accounting for 9.3% of our workforce). On the 
reporting date, our employees had worked for the Baye r Group for an average of 11 years (2022: 11). Our 
workforce includes only a small number of employees on temporary contracts (2.8%). 
Restructuring measures 
We act with social responsibility when changes and restructuring measur es are necessary. In all countries, 
we aim to minimize the impact on employees and find  mutually agreeable solu tions in cases where job 
reductions are necessary. This is also the case in Germany, where agreements are in place with employee 
representatives that fundamentally rule out dismissals for operational reasons in the intercompany personnel network of Bayer AG in the country until the end of 2026. 
With regard to the program to accelerate our transforma tion which we announced in 2020, we anticipate 
that all of the major restructuring measures will be im plemented by the end of 20 24. Flexible models with 
attractive conditio ns have been offered to employees of various age groups.  
Introduction of a new operating model 
We are currently working on making our organization even more closely aligned to our mission “Health for 
all, Hunger for none.” To this end, we are intr oducing a new operating model called Dynamic Shared 
Ownership (DSO). The new system is  more strongly orient ed toward customer needs and will empower our 
teams to meet these needs more effectively going forw ard and deploy our resources  even more efficiently. 
Our objective is for our employees to work in small, se lf-managed teams. Activities are prioritized on the 
basis of their contribution to the mission, and progre ss is measured in short, 90-day cycles, giving us 
much greater agility. This enables us to eliminate coordination work and reduce management layers.

Employee compensation and variable pay 
Our compensation system combines a basic salary refl ecting performance and responsibility with elements 
based on the company’s success, plus  additional benefits that incl ude stock participation programs. 
Members of upper management throughout the Bayer Group are invited to participate in Aspire, a uniform long-term compensation program based on the develo pment of the share price. Adjustments based on 
continuous benchmarking make our compensation internationally competitive.  
We provide attractive compensation fo r our active employees’ work and cont ribute to the financial security 
of our present and former employees after their retire ment. Retirement benefit plans are available to 79% 
(2022: 79%) of Bayer employees worldwide to complement national pension systems.

Personnel expenses declined by €1,928 million to €10,691 million in 2023 (2022: €12,6 19 million). This 
was mainly due to lower provisions for variable compensation under the Group-wide short-term incentive (STI) program. 
Our compensation principles consis t of providing fair compensation to all employees. As standard 
practice, we pay at least a “living wage,” which is  annually reviewed and defined worldwide by the 
nonprofit organization Business for Social Responsib ility, and compensate empl oyees on both permanent 
and temporary employment contracts in excess of the statutory minimum wage in many of the countries in which we operate.  
Vocational and ongoing training 
To meet our need for skilled employees, we hire apprentices in Germany in more than 28 different 
occupations. In total, we had 1,287 apprentices in 202 3. We also offer trainee programs in various areas 
for those embarking on a career, and inte rnships for students around the world. 
A wide range of ongoing training opportunities is ava ilable to our employees in the form of both e-learning 
and face-to-face training. Each employee engaged in an av erage of around 26 hours of ongoing training in 
2023. 
Work-life integration  
We help our employees balance their work and priv ate lives, and provide vari ous programs to support 
them, including flexible working arrangemen ts for how, when and where they work.  
In addition, we offer employees the opportunity to take  parental leave, while al so supporting them with 
childcare and the care of close relative s within the scope of social and le gal guidelines. In many countries, 
our commitment in this area goes beyo nd the statutory requirements.  
In 2023, part-time employees account ed for around 6% of our workfo rce (of which 51% were women and 
49% men), primarily in Europe. 
Health promotion 
Around 97% (2022: 97%) of our employees worldwide ei ther have statutory/privat e health insurance or can 
obtain health insuran ce through the company. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.4 Commitment to Employees 56
In 2023, we continued our BeWell@Bayer activities, which are aimed at promoting employee health and 
quality of life. This global framework concept expa nds the core aspect of h ealth into a comprehensive 
approach, targets further health im provements in the daily work envi ronment and is designed to help 
employees balance their professional and private lives. He alth check-ups are an integral part of our health 
promotion initiatives.  
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)11 
Our DE&I aspiration is to create an inclusive an d non-discriminatory work environment in which all 
employees are respected and everybody can be their authentic selves. To this end, we promote DE&I in all 
business areas and regions. 
We attach great importance to equal pay for men and wo men in comparable roles with similar levels of 
experience. The initial findings of a global review indicate minor gender-specific differences of less than 
2%. Further analysis will be conducte d in 2024 to determine whether th e identified differences in pay are 
due to factors other than gend er, with targeted adjustment measures to follow. 
Our Business Resource Groups (BRG) are part of our DE&I strategy. These are groups of volunteers, 
supported by the company, who work  together to promote cultural di versity, equity and awareness for 
DE&I. Each global BRG is sponsored by a member of  the Board of Management and an Executive Sponsor 
from the business. Their role is to act as mentors and provide guidance to ensure that critical DE&I 
objectives are achieved. In return, th ey receive insights from diverse pers pectives and in this way can help 
shape how we engage with customer s, community and our culture.  
In addition, we are integrating DE&I into core people processes such as talent acquisition and talent 
management. 
With 41,676 women employed at Bayer, the proporti on of women in the workforce remained almost 
constant at 42.1% (2022: 42.0%12). We are specifically targeting a gr eater gender balance in management. 
The proportion of women in management in 2023 was 43.6% (2022: 43.2%13). The proportion of women in 
top management, which encompasses the highest levels of management, including the Board of Management, increased again compared to previous years. At the end of 2023, it was made up of 31.8% 
women (2022: 27.9%
14) and 68.2% men (2022: 72.1%15). Top management comprises 556 people in total. 
Our top management currently comprises 40 nationalities (2022: 37), with around 69% (2022: 67%) of its 
members working in their native country. Information on diversity in our Board of Management and our Supervisory Board can be found in  our Corporate Governance Report. 
People with disabilities are an integral part of our wo rkforce. Based on voluntary statements by employees, 
we employ around 2,130 people with disabilities, 45% of whom are women and 55% men. That represents around 2.4% of our workforce in count ries where disabilities are tracked.  
In 2021, we announced commitments for gender balance throughout the Bayer Group. We aspire to 
increase the proportion of women on the entire top management level year by year to 33% by 2025. In addition, we intend to increase the average proporti on of women at all management levels to 50% by 
2025, and beyond. We then aim to increase the overall proportion of women in top management to 50% by 2030 as well. 
We have also defined additional commitments for further dimensions of diversity for 2025 and 2030, 
covering generations, nationality, career experience, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities, among others. 
Further aspects such as ethnic b ackground are integrated into our commitments for our regions and 
country organizations. 
 
11 Bayer generally reports its KPIs for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) in terms of headcount (HC). As of 2023, key figures in the DE&I 
chapters of the annual and sustainability reports are therefore based on HC as well, in order to cover the individual character istics of our 
employees independent of their working hours. To ensure comparability, we are presenting the 2022 figures in this chapter in HC  as well. Key 
figures in other chapters may differ from those in this chapter as they are still based on full-time equivalents (FTE).

1.5 Procurement and Supplier Management 57
1.5 Procurement and Supplier Management 
We have an impact on society and the environm ent through our procurement activities and supplier 
relationships. Not only economic but also ethical, social and ecological pr inciples are therefore anchored in 
our Procurement Policy, which is bind ing for all employees worldwide.  
As a cross-divisional enabling function, Procurement leverages synergies by bundling know-how and 
procurement spend. In 2023, we had a total of around 86 thousand (2022: 91 thousand) suppliers. Our 
procurement spend was €22.7 b illion (2022: €23.3 billion).  
Our main direct procurement material s include active ingredients, raw materials, intermediates, finished 
products and seeds. Technical goods and services , research and development (R&D) resources, and 
marketing and IT services are important compon ents of our indirect procurement portfolio.  
Procurement operates according to advanced procur ement and supplier management processes. Long-
term contracts and dedicated supplier management for strategically important goods and services are key 
elements here. They serve to minimize procurement-sp ecific risks such as supply disruptions or significant 
price fluctuations, while also helping to safeguard our company’s competitiven ess and ensure smooth 
production processes. 
To meet our climate protection targets, Procuremen t takes and supports measures to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions in our supply ch ain (Scope 3). We advanced our ac tivities from 2022 and initiated 
new ones in 2023. We continue to lead a dedicat ed “GHG Scope 3 Emissions” workstream in the 
Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative, which in a pilot project demonstrated the scalability of product 
carbon footprint (PCF) data exchange, and have also  been working with the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) Supply Chain.   
In 2023, we focused our effo rts among other things on organizing training session s on human rights in the 
supply chain for our procurement em ployees and suppliers, as well as on enhancing our procurement 
processes in order to comply with the Germ an Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCDDA).  
Likewise in 2023, we introduced the Bayer Supplier In clusion & Diversity Program,  which is designed to 
ensure that there are consistent and equitable op portunities for small and diverse-owned suppliers 
throughout the global supply chain.  
Our global teams have continued to take extensive action to increase the res ilience of our supply chain 
and mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine.  
In 2023, we signed a long-term st ructured renewable energy credit (REC) purchase agreement with Cat 
Creek Energy (CCE), a renewable energy Independ ent Power Producer, to si gnificantly increase the 
proportion of renewable energy used  in our own production facilities. 
Sustainability in the supply chain 
Clear sustainability criteria and standards are in place for our supply chain on both  a global and regional 
level. With the goal of improving sustainable practices  in our supply chain, we operate a Group-wide four-
step management process that comprises the following  elements: raising awareness, supplier nomination, 
supplier evaluation and supplier development.  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.6 Sustainability Management 58
Our sustainability requirements are established in th e Bayer Supplier Code of Conduct, which is based on 
our Bayer Human Rights Policy and the principles of the UN Global Compact. This code serves as the 
basis for selecting and evaluating  our suppliers and is integrated  into electronic ordering systems 
throughout the Bayer Group. Furthermore, our standard  supply contracts contain a clause that authorizes 
us to verify suppliers’ compliance with our sustai nability requirements. The Bayer Supplier Code of 
Conduct Guidance was updated in 2023 and also  contains GSCDDA-specific requirements.  
We verify suppliers’ observance of the code requiremen ts with the aid of online assessments or audits. We 
evaluate suppliers of relevant importance and suppliers  with a high sustainabilit y risk (in terms of both 
country and category risks). We also consider in our processes existing evaluations performed within the 
scope of the two sustainability industry initiatives we ar e a part of. In total, our service provider EcoVadis 
assessed 1,118 (2022: 1,145) suppliers on our behalf in 2023. Also in 2023, we arranged for 134 (2022: 
113) of our suppliers to be audited by internal and/or external, independent auditors.  
If critical results are recorded as  a result of a serious violation or several major shortcomings being 
identified during a supplier’s sust ainability performance evaluation, specific improvement measures are 
then jointly defined. We monitor the implementation of these activities through re-assessments or follow-up audits. We reserve the right to terminate a supplier re lationship if insufficient improvements are observed 
during re-evaluations. In 2023, we  were not prompted to end any supplier relationship solely due to 
sustainability performance.  
1.6 Sustainability Management 
Sustainability is one of our strategi c levers. That means that our busi ness activities ar e systematically 
geared toward generating a positive  impact for people and the planet . Effective sustainability management 
throughout the organization is ensured by clearly d efined roles and responsibilities. The Chairman of the 
Board of Management (CEO), in his capacity as Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO),  and the entire Board of 
Management hold first-level responsibility for this strategy. An external Sustainability Council advises the 
Board of Management on all matters relating to sustaina bility and offers a critical, constructive perspective. 
In addition, we have a Human Rights Officer who oversees the management of risks relating to human 
rights and provides updates to the Board of Management. In 2022, we established a separate Supervisory 
Board committee for the areas of environmental protect ion, social affairs and co rporate governance (ESG 
Committee). The committee oversees and advises management on inte grating sustainability into the 
business strategy and corporate governance, as well as  on sustainability-related opportunities and risks, 
including potential consequences for the company’s repu tation. In addition, the Public Affairs, Science and 
Sustainability; Health, Safety, Environment (PASS & HSE) enabling function su pports the CSO and Board 
of Management in identifying risk s and opportunities, developing stra tegies and defining sustainability 
management targets and guidelines. It also provides  governance for sustainab ility topics. Sustainability 
management is integrated into the existing ma nagement and governance st ructures and the core 
processes of the entire organization.  
Our commitment to the UN Global Compact and the Respon sible Care™ initiative of the chemical industry 
and our involvement in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) underline our 
profile as a company that acts sustainably.

1.6 Sustainability Management 59
Materiality analysis and stakeholder dialogue  
We ascertain the expectations and requirements of ou r various stakeholders using a materiality analysis, 
which surveys external stakeholders and manageri al employees from various areas of the company 
throughout the world. The results of  this reveal the latest developmen ts along with sustainability-related 
opportunities and risks. Areas of activity with a very hi gh level of relevance from an internal and external 
perspective are accounted for in our strategic lever of sustainability and reflected in our nonfinancial Group 
targets. The current materiality analysis co vers the following key areas of activity: 
// Innovation 
// Access to healthcare 
// Sustainable food supply 
// Product stewardship 
// Climate and environmental protection 
// Business ethics 
We are currently in the preparatio n phase with respect to the disclosures to be made in accordance with 
the EU Corporate Sustainability Re porting Directive (CSRD), which in volves updating our materiality 
analysis, taking into account the requirements of th e European Sustainability Re porting Standards (ESRS). 
As part of our stakeholder engagement process, which is underpinned by a dedicated guideline, we 
approach key social and political pl ayers and seek dialogue from the ou tset in strategic decision-making 
processes regarding new projects such as invest ment projects and launches of new products. 
Social engagement 
We are committed to supporting scien ce, society and the common good. Li ke our business activities, our 
social engagement is guided by our purpose “Science for a better life”  and our mission “Health for all, 
Hunger for none.” Together with our network of pa rtners and our employees, we  support social projects 
around the world in the areas of health, nutrition and the environment and enga ge with communities to 
create long-lasting societal impact. As part of these endeavors, we  increasingly support social innovation 
and social enterprises. Responding to disasters by pr oviding humanitarian aid also plays a crucial role in 
our social commitment. Through our disaster relief pr ograms, we support communities affected by natural 
disasters and public health crises. 
In 2023, we provided aro und €52 million for social im pact programs worldwide. This included products 
costing around €18 million that we donated to organizations in countries  and communities in need. 66% of 
our (cash and product) contributions went to low- and middle-income countries. In 2023, we conducted projects worldwide with partner organizations, includ ing the Bayer foundations (Bayer Foundation [focusing 
on the global south and life sciences], Bayer Fund [USA], Bayer Foundation India and Hans and Berthold Finkelstein Foundation [active in Germany, other Eu ropean countries and Israel]), which generate an 
important impact for society in line with  our mission and corporate purpose.  
Our workforce is likewise personally  involved in community  volunteering. In 2018, for example, our 
employees founded the PROSI (Pro Social Initiatives) program, which brings together employees worldwide to engage in social volunteering. Building on the successes of PROSI, 2023 also saw the introduction of the Group’s “Corporate Volunteering” framework, which allows employees to spend at least 
one workday per year volunteering with social or ganizations. Germany implemented the concept in 
October – other countries will follow. Employees can us e an online platform for vo lunteering to search for 
organizations and also propose projects themselves. Existing volunteer programs (e.g. in the United States) will be continued or combined und er the “Corporate Volunteering” scheme. 
The contributions we make – in the form of monetary, product or other in-kind donations – are governed 
by our global “Corporate Charitable Giving Procedure.” It establishes clea r criteria for recipient eligibility 
and project selection, and also sets forth the strategy we follow to genera te long-term impact for society in 
line with our sustainability goals. Ou r charitable contributions are reco rded and approved centrally, which 
provides a transparent overview of our contributi ons to supporting social causes around the world.

Respect for human rights  
Respecting human rights is fundamental to the way we operate. We have documented our stance in a 
globally binding corporate policy en titled the Bayer Human Rights Policy. In 2023, we further developed 
our corresponding strategy and updated our human righ ts policy. The position of Human Rights Officer 
has been in place in our organization since October 202 2. This function is tasked with performing risk 
management oversight and providing the Board of Mana gement with updates on human rights topics. The 
Board of Management received such u pdates on three occasions in 2023. 
Human rights due diligence is a cont inuous process that we constantly  adapt and improve. To specifically 
ensure respect for human rights in the value chain, we employ a due diligence approach based on the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business an d Human Rights (UNGPs) and the OE CD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises. We take steps to ensure human rights are respected both within our own company and along 
our entire value chain. Corporate policies, processe s, and management and monitoring systems are in 
place to govern the implementation of  human rights standards. We offer special training programs to 
continuously enhance empl oyees’ awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to-day 
activities. The “Respecting Human Rights at Bayer” ba sic training course is one such example. We also 
demand that our business partners, particularly  our suppliers, fully respect human rights.  
We are a founding member of the UN Global Compact  and respect the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the UN International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the UNGPs and a range of globally recogn ized declarations appl icable to multinational 
corporations, including the OECD Guidelines for Multin ational Enterprises, the Tripartite Declaration of 
Principles concerning Mult inational Enterprises and Social Policy,  and the core labor standards of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO).  
As part of our risk management process, we conduct overarching and detailed risk analysis to examine the 
potentially adverse consequences our operating activities could have for human rights. See the 
Opportunity and Risk Report for the risk status identified for this area in 2023. We did not identify any 
potentially negative effects that were reportab le under the CSR Directive Implementation Act. 
1.7 Product Stewardship 
For Bayer, product stewardship involves ensuring that our products satisfy the highest quality standards 
and are safe for people and the environment when used  correctly. We respect the legal requirements and 
even go beyond them in various ar eas through voluntary commitments and internal standards. We have 
put in place suitable directives and management systems for the implementa tion of regulatory and 
voluntary product stewardship requir ements that are steered by our Sustainability, Safety, Health & 
Environment (SSHE) enabling function and the quality functions of the divisions. 
Assessment and testing of active ingredients and products 
Our substances and finished products undergo extensive assessment and testing along the entire value chain. Based on these results, we develop measures  to minimize health and environmental risks. Our 
divisions have quality management systems in place that are based on intern ational industry-specific 
standards. By implementing a binding company-wide quality assurance system, we aim to guarantee high-
quality, safe and effective products an d services that satisfy all intern al and external requirements and 
meet customer expectations. This helps to avoid customer complaints, pr oduct recalls and other 
problems. For all chemical substances, we compile s afety data sheets targeting professional users. End 
consumer products contain appropri ate information in their packaging,  with one example being package 
inserts for pharmaceuticals. We also conduct envi ronmental risk assessments and implement risk 
management measures after a product has been registered. 
At 
Crop Science , we steer product stewardship through the strategy and sustainability function. As 
specified in a group regulation, we  apply a life-cycle approach which follows internationally recognized 
standards such as the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the 
guidelines of the crop protection association CropLife International, an d the guidelines of the industry 
initiative Excellence Through Stewar dship (ETS) for seeds and traits.  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.7 Product Stewardship 61
Every single R&D project must under go a safety assessment ba sed on our high internal product safety 
standards, which often go beyond local regulatory re quirements. This assessmen t also takes into account 
local circumstances in relation to the combination of crops and countries, as well as application patterns. 
All of this is supplemented by our voluntary safety commitments: We  have not marketed any crop 
protection products that are classified by the WHO as being highly toxic (WHO Tox Class I) since as early 
as 2012. In addition, since 2016 we have marketed only crop protection produc ts with active ingredients 
that have a registration in at least one OECD count ry, and only new active ingredients for which an OECD 
data package has been compiled.  
Furthermore, our customers are provided with co mprehensive and transparent information on our 
products. Through a variety of extensive programs, we train farmers, seed treatmen t professionals, dealers 
and other users in the effective and s afe handling and use of our products . This covers aspects such as 
the correct use of personal protective equipment ( PPE) and the proper handling of empty containers. 
During the production, packaging, storage and transpor t phase, we rely on a globally applicable health, 
safety and environmental prot ection management system. 
We aim to strengthen all stakeholders’ confidence in our products through transparency. Details on our 
product stewardship and high internal  product safety standards are public ly available on our website. In 
addition, we were one of the first companies in agricu lture to make safety-relevant data on crop protection 
products and genetically modified seed publicly accessi ble. Summaries of scientific studies for 30 of our 
active ingredients submitted to the Eu ropean Food Safety Authority (EFSA)  in the context of registration 
procedures are available on our website. These reports include information on toxicological and 
ecotoxicological studies and investigations into the biodegradability of crop protection products. Also 
available are summaries of scientific studies on 16 tr aits of our genetically modified crops that were 
evaluated by US regulatory authorities. Complete stud y reports on our registration studies for the approval 
of our crop protection products and genetically mo dified crops are available on specific request.  
In the Pharmaceuticals  Division, we assess the medical benefit- risk profile of our pharmaceutical and 
medicinal products throughout th eir entire product life cycle. Th e efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
pharmaceuticals are already investig ated in preclinical and Phase I to III clinical development studies. 
These results and the ben efit-risk assessment are su bmitted to the relevant authorities during the 
pharmaceutical registration process.  We continue to compile safety-rele vant information in a dedicated 
database following market launch of the product.  
Post-Authorization Safety Studies ( PASS) are also conducted after appr oval. The results are entered into 
the PASS registry in compliance with EU pharmacovigilance legislation. 
After proving the efficacy and safety of a no nprescription (OTC) medicinal product, Consumer Health  
receives marketing authorization from the relevant au thorities. We continuous ly ensure the favorable 
benefit-risk profile of these products by conducting post-marketing surveillance and generating scientific 
evidence throughout the entire prod uct life cycle. In addition to thes e OTC products, Consumer Health 
also provides consumers access to other self-care solutions, cosmet ics, nutritional supplements and 
medical devices. We conduct ongoing monitoring and measurements to ensure safety, efficacy and 
compliance with regulatory requiremen ts around the world. We also monitor ingredients across all product 
categories and act on any concerns th at are identified to provide the best -quality products for our patients 
and consumers. 
Animal welfare in active ingredient testing 
Animal studies are legally required and essential from  a scientific viewpoint for assessing the safety and 
efficacy of our products. Such studies must comply not only with legal requirements but also with Bayer’s 
principles on animal welfare and animal studies. The latter also apply both to the research institutes we 
commission and to our suppliers, whose compliance with  our animal welfare requirements we monitor 
regularly. We aim to minimize the use of study an imals and to employ alternative methods whenever 
possible. In early drug research, Ba yer continuously makes use of differen t in silico and in  vitro processes 
that help reduce the number of animal studies; included  in this are our activities  with “organ-on-a-chip.”

Environmental impact 
Biodiversity 
Agriculture can benefit significantly from species that provide and main tain important ecosystem services 
such as pollination and natural pe st control and perform soil-rela ted functions such as nutrient 
replenishment. At the same time, the very purpose of agriculture is to provide a safe and secure food 
supply for humans, which can lead to a loss or reduct ion of biodiversity, for example through land-use 
change, degradation or fragmentation of habitats. To foster production which minimizes the impact on the 
environment, we are investigating and developing cultivation systems that help achieve a better balance 
between productivity and the conservation of soil heal th and habitats. In many of our field trials, we 
evaluate how our solutions – in comb ination with practices such as no  till, cover crops or wider crop 
rotation – help to improve soil heal th without compromising farmers’ pr ofitability. In addition, we have 
various cooperation pr ojects involving the Bayer Fo rwardFarms and nature cons ervation experts where we 
research how a better balance could be achie ved in various countries and regions.  
We also support and encourage th e development of integrated pest  management (IPM) and pollinator 
management methods that conserve the abundance and diversity of benefi cial insects, pr otect pollinators 
and reduce the use of pesticides or replace compound s with a less favorable en vironmental safety profile 
with modern, more environmentally friendly solution s. We therefore conduct comprehensive field trials 
under agronomic conditions in va rious crops around the globe with the objective of deriving 
recommendations regarding the best positioning of our products within an IPM system to protect pollinators and beneficials. 
We promote the responsible use of natural resources, both complying with international and national 
legislation as well as respecting bi odiversity. Our principles on biodiv ersity are set forth in a corporate 
policy and a separate position paper on  this issue. In this, we express our commitment to the objectives of 
the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which includes the fair and equitable sharing of the 
benefits arising from the use of genetic resources. We  also have a supplementary corporate policy in place 
that is designed to ensure compliance with international and national legislation on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of the be nefits arising from the use of genetic resources. 
Through monetary and nonmonetary contributions to the establishment of new gene banks that serve to 
preserve the genetic diversity of crops, we help to facilitate the conservation an d sustainable use of plant 
genetic resources. In addition, we participate in a va riety of projects with public partners to enable 
improved local food crops and promote the build-up of capacities to breed better crops, while also 
supporting other global efforts to preser ve biodiversity. Furthermore, we continually deploy plant breeding 
innovations that help improve the ge netic diversity of crops, food secu rity and ecological sustainability. 
Biotechnology 
We apply biotechnological methods in  biopharmaceutical production (e.g ., Kogenate™, Kovaltry™, Jivi™) 
and the development of innovative biopharmaceuticals, and cell and gene therapies. In addition, we apply 
biotech-based methods to seeds (e.g., SmartStax™ PR O with RNAi Technology corn, Intacta 2 Xtend™ 
soybeans, and Bollgard™ 3 with Xten dFlex™ cotton). In plant breeding,  we use a variety of methods, 
including conventional breeding appr oaches and genetic engineering. Ge netically modified crops can help 
increase the sustainability of food production because they enable farmers to produce more food with less 
impact on natural resources.
  
For us, the safety of people and the environment is always the top priority in the use of biotechnology. In addition to meeting legal and regulatory requirements , we have specified the responsible use of genetic 
engineering and strict, globally applicable safety measures for handling biological substances in 
corresponding corporate policies.  
The development and commercialization of genetically improved seeds are also subject to stringent laws 
and regulations. In addition, we have established internal processes to ensure the responsible use of 
biotechnologically manufactured prod ucts throughout their life cycle.  Furthermore, our Crop Science 
Division maintained its membership  in the Excellence Through Stewardship organization in 2023. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.8 Environmental Protection and Safety 63
Trace substances in the environment 
We are committed to preventing emissions of prod uct residues (e.g., active ingredients and their 
degradation products) into the environment or, where these are unavoidable, to minimize the risks they harbor. We focus on all stages of the product cy cle – from manufacturing to safe use and disposal.  
At our production sites around the world, regulatory authorities and external assessors monitor compliance 
with wastewater thresholds. Internal experts also perf orm corresponding audits of the production sites at 
regular intervals. We take appropriate action in our production facilities to avoid or reduce emissions from 
production, such as the release of active ingredients into the environment. Alongside the regulatory standards, such action also comes in the form of ou r own, more far-reaching en vironmental standards, for 
instance as outlined in our corpor ate policies. We are also working to develop further effective risk 
minimization measures in va rious research projects.  
With regard to the application of crop protection products, the potential environmental impact is 
investigated in ecotoxicological st udies during development and prior to the official product approval 
process. The responsible authorities receive an exte nsive environmental risk assessment and can specify 
risk minimization measures as appropriate.  
Environmental risk assessments are also conducted in  Europe and the United States for the official 
approval of human pharmaceuticals. 
1.8 Environmental Protection and Safety 
We are working on ways to further reduce the enviro nmental impact of our business activities and develop 
solutions that relieve the burden on the environment.  Responsibility for this lie s with the Sustainability, 
Safety, Health & Environment (SSHE) enabling function , which defines framework co nditions in the form of 
corporate policies and other measures. We us e management systems to  control operational 
implementation in the divisions. 
Energy consumption 
Bayer’s total energy consumption decreased by 1.3% year on year to 35.0 petajoules in 2023 (2022: 35.5 petajoules). This includes both primary energy consumption, which mainly relates to fossil fuels, and 
secondary energy consumption. The decline was attributable to lower production volumes at our sites in 
Soda Springs, United Stat es, and Antwerp, Belgium. 
Energy efficiency reported as the ratio of en ergy consumed to external sales came in at 
204 kWh/€ thousand in 2023, compared with 194 kWh/€ thousand in 2022. 
Greenhouse gas emissions  
We consider climate protection and the related reduct ion of greenhouse gas emissions to be a top priority. 
We have therefore set ourselves ambitious targets in this area, and these are ex plained in more detail in 
Chapter 1.2.1 Strategy and Targets.  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report

The following table provides an over view of the development in 2023: 
A 1.8/1 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
Million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents 2022 2023
Scope 1: Direct emissions1 1.91 1.89
Scope 2: Indirect emissions2 according to the market-based method 1.12 1.11
Total greenhouse gas emissions according to the market-based method 3.03 3.00
Scope 3: Indirect emissions from our upstream and downstream value chains (by materiality)3, 4, 7 9.72 9.18
of which indirect emissions from our upstream value chain to attain the SBT4, 5, 6, 7 8.98 8.44
   
1 Direct emissions result from our own power plants, vehicles, waste incineration plants and production facilities (Scope 1).  
In line with the GHG Protocol, we also report the direct emissions that arise through the generation of energy that we sell to other companies 
as a site service. Consequently, the figures for direct emissions of the Bayer Group are higher than the actual emissions resul ting from Bayer’s 
business activities alone. In 2023, 97.2% of direct greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide emissions. Other greenhouse ga ses such as 
nitrous oxide, partially fluorinated hydrocarbons and methane made a negligible contribution to direct greenhouse gas emissions .  
2 Indirect emissions result from the procurement of electricity, steam and cooling energy (Scope 2). 
3 Scope 3 emissions were subjected to a limited assurance review. 
4 Emissions from eight Scope 3 categories are of material importance to Bayer and together represent our total Scope 3 emissions : (1) 
purchased goods and services, (2) capital goods, (3) fuel- and energy-related activities, (4) (upstream) transportation and dis tribution, (5) waste 
generated in operations, (6) business travel, (7) employee commuting and (12) end-of-life treatment of sold products. 
5 Science Based Target 
6 For our reduction target for Scope 3 emissions in line with the SBTi, we consider the following materially important Scope 3 c ategories, which 
accounted for 88% of Scope 3 emissions in the baseline year: (1) purchased goods and services, (2) capital goods, (3) fuel- and  energy-related 
activities, (4) (upstream) transportation and distribution and (6) business travel. 
7 Values for 2022 were updated due to new findings in category 3.1. 
In 2023, we cut Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 0.03 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents, 
or 0.9%. The main reasons for this reduction are the increased share of electricity purchased from 
renewable sources (Scope 2).  
In the Scope 3 Science Based Targets (SBT) categories that are relevant for ou r company, our emissions 
fell by 0.54 million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents, representing a decrea se of 6.0% compared with 2022. 
The reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the SBT-releva nt Scope 3 categories was largely attributable to 
lower purchasing volumes (Scope 3.1)  and the associated logistics oper ations (Scope 3.4). Emissions in 
the non-SBT-relevant categories (Scope 3.5, 3.7 and 3.12) decreased slight ly year on year, by 
4,500 metric tons (–0.6%).  
To achieve carbon neutrality at our own sites, we finan ced reforestation and forest conservation projects in 
countries such as Brazil, Indonesi a, Cambodia, Colombia and Uruguay.  The climate protection certificates 
generated as a result enabled us to offset greenhous e gas emissions amounting to 0.6 million metric tons 
of CO 2 equivalents. 
Water 
We use water resources as sparingly as possible an d are endeavoring to further reduce emissions into 
water. All relevant sites in areas identified as being threatened by water scarcity through 2030 have a water management system in place.  
Total water use in 2023 remained le vel year on year at 53 million cubic meters (2022: 53 million cubic 
meters). 32.4% of all water used by Bayer is cooling water that is only heated in the process and does not come into contact with products. It can be returned to  the water cycle, in line with the relevant official 
permits. 
At our production facilities, we endeavor to use wate r several times and to recycle it. All wastewater is 
subject to thorough checks b efore it is discharged into the various disposal channels. All our industrial and 
mixed wastewater is purified in wastewater trea tment plants (Bayer or third-party facilities) where 
necessary, categorized as environmen tally safe according to official provis ions and returned to the natural 
water cycle. The total quantity of industrial and mixed wastewater cam e in at 25 million cubic meters in 
2023 and was thus 2.8% higher than the previous year (202 2: 24 million cubic meters). 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.8 Environmental Protection and Safety 65
Waste and recycling 
We aim to minimize material consumption and dispos al volumes through systematic waste management. 
In accordance with Bayer’s corporate policies, all production sites are required to prevent, reduce and 
recycle waste, and to dispose of  it safely and in line with go od environmental practices.  
The total quantity of waste generated rose to 1,164, 000 metric tons in 2023 (2022: 1,038,000 metric 
tons), mainly due to increased production at the Dormagen site in Germany and the completion of 
construction work at the Leverkusen site in Germany. 
The volume of hazardous waste rose by 14.4% to 316,000 metric tons (2022: 276,000 metric tons) due to 
the increase in production at the Dormagen site. The volume of hazardous waste from production in this figure, including hazardous waste from wastewater treatment plants, also increased against the prior year, 
rising from 273,000 metric tons to 312,000 metric tons.  
Process and plant safety 
We aim to design and operate our pro cesses and production facilities in su ch a way that they do not pose 
any inappropriate risks to employees, the environm ent or neighboring communities. We are working to 
further develop our safety culture and the expertise of our employees. Principles of process and plant 
safety are laid out in our globally applicable corporate policies. Compliance with internal and external 
safety regulations is verifi ed in internal audits.  
To prevent the release of substances and energy, the causes of process safety incidents (PSIs) are 
analyzed and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Bayer Gr oup. For this purpose, we use a 
globally standardized key performan ce indicator (KPI) – the Process Safety  Incident Rate (PSI-R) – that is 
integrated into the Group-wide reporting system. Th e PSI-R indicates the number of PSI incidents per 
200,000 hours worked. In 2023, the PSI-R was 0.11 (2022: 0.11). 
Transportation safety 
Transportation and wareho use safety is part of HSE management and is implemented by networks of 
supply chain experts. In addition to  complying with legal regulations, we have implemented supplementary 
standards and requirements that are defined in corp orate policies. This ensures that our materials are 
handled and transported in accordance wi th their respective potential haza rds and applicable regulations.  
There were 18 transp ort incidents in 2023 (2022: 17), primarily involving ro ad transport accidents. We 
define transport incidents as accide nts that cause personal injury or  significant damage to property, 
environmental impact resulting from the release of substances, or leakage of hazardous goods. 
Safe and health-promoting working conditions 
Protecting the health of our workfor ce and the employees of contractual partners who work on our factory 
premises is our top priority. We are now also ex tending these ambitions to our supply chains. We are 
committed to systematic prevention measures for heal thy working conditions and safety in everyday work, 
in production facilities and during work-related travel and transporta tion. This involves preventing 
occupational accidents and occupational illnesses, assessing potent ial hazards, ensuring comprehensive 
risk management and creating a healthy working environment.  
The “Recordable Incident Rate” (RIR) was 0.42 accident s per 200,000 working hour s in 2023 (2022: 0.37). 
This corresponds to 457 occupa tional accidents worldwide.  
Despite all the safety measures, serious and extremel y serious accidents cannot be  completely ruled out. 
In 2023, we reported seven fatal accidents (all traffi c accidents) at work involving a Bayer employee. We 
will not let up in our efforts to furthe r reduce risks and risky behavior. 
Moreover, our Purchasing and R&D teams work to redu ce the severity of any accidents and to ensure 
accountability to avoid incident recurre nces. We focus on the prevention  of incidents and the effectiveness 
of corrective and preventive measures. The focus was al so on reporting on identi fied risks, analyzing the 
causes of potentially serious incidents, evaluating th e effectiveness of corrective measures and passing on 
the knowledge gained. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.8 Environmental Protection and Safety 66
Furthermore, we published global road safety standards and implementation guidance in 2023, and 
started collecting traffic accident  data to track progress. 
In order to protect the mental heal th of our employees and their familie s, we remain committed to taking 
active steps to counteract the develo pment of mental illnesses through a variety of target  group-specific 
information and programs. One example is the central “House of Health” intranet platform, which lists a 
large variety of information and training offerings. In  addition, we provided “ Employee Assistance Program” 
offers for 97% of employees and their families worldwide in 2023. Run by external  providers, they offer

Our sustainability targets (Chapter 1.2.1/1) help us to realize our mission of “Health for all, Hunger for 
none.” In addition, we also report on other nonfinancial aspects. For 20 23, we are required to disclose the 
proportion of turnover (sales), capital expenditur e (CapEx), and operating expenditure (OpEx) in the 
reporting period that is EU taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned with regard to the environmental objectives climate change mitigation and climate chan ge adaptation. For the four additional environmental 
objectives sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular 
economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and 
ecosystems, by contrast, we  are only required to disclose taxonomy -eligible turnover, capital expenditure 
and operating expenditure.  
Company activities are assessed for taxonomy eligibility based on the economic activities described in 
Annexes I and II to the Delegated Act of June 4, 20 21, and Annexes I through IV to the Delegated Act of 
June 27, 2023. To avoid double-counting, results ar e documented for example at product master data 
level. Taxonomy alignment is evaluated based on the technical screening criteria for each economic 
activity, which are also defined in the aforementioned Annexes. 
We use our own interpretation when applying the EU taxonomy as definitions are not yet available and the 
wording used is unclear. The FAQ documents published by the Europe an Commission as of December 31, 
2023, were duly taken into account. 
Reporting on turnover 
The definition of turnover according to EU taxonomy corresponds with the sales reported in the consolidated financial st atements (see Note [6]). 
A portion of our core business became taxonomy-elig ible for the first time through the passage of 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/24 86 of June 27, 2023, due to an economic activity “manufacture of 
medicinal products” which can contribu te to the environmental objective pollution prevention and control. 
Sales of the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divi sions can be attributed to this economic activity.  
The determination of taxonomy-eligible sales takes place at product level. According to our interpretation, 
sales generated from medicinal products that are me rely resold, repackaged or mixed are not taxonomy-
eligible. 
Taxonomy-eligible sales amounted to €18,299 million in 2023 (2022: €0 m illion), and taxonomy-non-
eligible sales amounted to €29,338 million (2022: €50,739 million). The proportion of taxonomy-eligible 
sales was thus 38.4% (2022: 0%). Due to the simplified reporting requirements for 2023 with respect to the four environmental objectives to be applied for the first time, there are no taxonomy-aligned sales to 
disclose.

Reporting on capital expenditure 
Capital expenditure in 2023 comprised investments in tangible and intang ible assets before depreciation, 
amortization, impairments and remeasurements. Also incl uded were investments in tangible and intangible 
assets due to business combinations. For fu rther details, see Notes [14] and [15].  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
1.8 Environmental Protection and Safety 69
The taxonomy-eligible capital expendit ure is determined by linking the capital expenditure undertaken with 
the taxonomy-eligible products (Category a). Capital ex penditure that cannot be clearly assigned is taken 
into consideration on the basis of allocation keys. Capital expenditures for the purchase of products from taxonomy-eligible economi c activities or individual measures  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
(Category c) are also incl uded in this figure.  
As explained in the previous sect ion, no taxonomy alignment review was undertaken in 2023 for the 
economic activity “manufacture of medi cinal products.” Furthermore, at present there is no process for 
reliably verifying the acquisition of taxonomy-aligned products in Category c. The procedure for the remaining capital expenditure in conn ection with the environmental object ive climate change mitigation is 
described below. 
We examine whether or not an economic activity contri butes substantially to climate change mitigation 
based on the individual asset. 
To rule out significant harm being caused to other environmental objectives, we assess the respective 
criteria at various levels. The criteria for climate chan ge adaptation are assessed at site level, while the in 
some cases highly granular requirements for the ot her environmental objectiv es are examined at the 
individual asset level.  
Compliance with the minimum safeguards is examined  at Group level, taking into account existing 
corporate policies and risk management proce sses with respect to human rights, compliance, 
anticorruption and other aspects.  
We incurred taxonomy-eligible capit al expenditure (CapEx) of €543 million in 2023 (2022: €390 million). 
Taxonomy-non-eligible capital ex penditure amounted to €2,798 m illion (2022: €3,250 million). The 
proportion of taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure therefore came to 16.3% (202 2: 10.7%). We were once 
again unable to identify any taxonomy-aligne d capital expenditur e (2022: €0 million).

Reporting on operating expenditure 
Our operating expenditure with respect to resear ch and development, short-term leasing, and 
maintenance and repair amounted to €7, 204 million in 2023 (2022: €7,460 million). 
Taxonomy-eligible operating expend iture amounted to €1 61 million (2022: €0 million), and taxonomy-non-
eligible operating expenditure amounted to €7,04 3 million (2022: €7,460 million). The proportion of 
taxonomy-eligible operating expend iture therefore came to  2.2% (2022: 0%). Due to the simplified 
reporting requirements for 2023 with respect to the four  environmental objectives to be applied for the first 
time, there is no taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure to disclose.

2.1 Overview of Business Performance 75
2. Report on Economic Position 
2.1 Overview of Business Performance 
2.1.1 Economic Position and Target Attainment 
2023 was a challenging year for our company. Sale s edged back 1.2% on a currency- and portfolio-
adjusted basis (Fx & portfolio adj.), while EBITDA b efore special items fell by a considerable 13.4%. The 
EBITDA margin before special item s came in at 24.6%, down 2.0 percentage points against the previous 
year. This was largely due to the decline in busine ss at Crop Science, which, in turn, was mainly 
attributable to significantly lower prices for our glyphosate-based products. Sales in that division fell 
accordingly, moving back by 3.7% (Fx & portfolio ad j.), and EBITDA before sp ecial items declined by 
26.6%. Sales at Pharmaceuticals were at the prior-year  level (Fx & portfolio adj. –0.4% ), while EBITDA 
before special items fell by 11.6%. Consumer Health registered encouraging sales growth of 6.3% (Fx & 
portfolio adj.) and a 3.2% increase in EBITDA befo re special items. Our business was impacted by 
substantial currency headwinds over all. Group earnings per share (total ) came in at minus €2.99 in 2023, 
and were mainly weighed down by impairment losses.  Core earnings per share dropped by a considerable 
19.5% to €6.39.  
In the Group outlook published in Ma rch, we anticipated sales of €50 to €51 billion, corresponding to an 
increase of 2% to 3% on a currency- and portfolio-a djusted basis. EBITDA before special items was 
forecast to come in at €12.5 to €13  billion, and earnings per share befo re special items at €7.20 to €7.40. 
Free cash flow was projected to be around €3.0 billion.  
The forecast was revised in August due to the weaker-than- expected business performance. As part of 
this updated guidance, we anticipa ted sales of €46.8 to €47.8 billion,  corresponding to  a currency- and 
portfolio-adjusted decline of  2% to 3%. EBITDA before special items was predicted to come in at €11.3 to 
€11.8 billion, and core earnings per share at €6.2 0 to €6.40. Free cash flow was expected to be 
approximately €0 billion. 
We exceeded this adjusted Group outlook with respec t to currency- and portfoli o-adjusted sales growth 
and free cash flow. EBITDA before special items and co re earnings per share were both at the upper end 
of the target range.

2.1.2 Key Events 
Board of Management 
The Supervisory Board of Bayer AG appointed Bill Anderson to become Chai rman of the Board of 
Management (CEO) of Bayer effective June 1, 2023. An derson had already joined Bayer as a member of 
the Board of Management on April 1, 2023. Werner  Baumann and the Supervis ory Board had previously 
agreed to prematurely terminate Baumann’s contract as Chairman (CEO) and member of the Board of 
Management, which was originally set to run until Ap ril 30, 2024. His service contract and tenure as 
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) ended by mutual consent effective May 31, 2023. 
The Supervisory Board of Bayer AG also unanimous ly appointed Heike Prinz to Bayer’s Board of 
Management as Chief Talent Officer and Labor Direc tor effective September 1, 2023. This followed the 
mutual agreement between Sarena Lin and the Superv isory Board to not extend Lin’s contract as a 
member of the Board of Management. Sarena Li n left the company effecti ve August 31, 2023. 
Innovations and product approvals 
The following significant events relating to our innovative products occurred in 2023 and early 2024. 
Our cancer drug Nubeqa™, which is currently in the la unch phase, was granted a label extension in Japan, 
the EU and China for the treatment of patients wi th metastatic hormone-se nsitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC) in 2023. 
Based on the recommendation of th e study’s Independent Data Monito ring Committee (IDMC), we decided 
to stop OCEANIC-AF, a Phase III study investigating our development candidate asundexian. An ongoing 
surveillance showed that asundexian 50 mg was not as effective as the F actor Xa inhibitor in the control 
arm in SPAF, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillati on. We will continue to investigate asundexian in the 
Phase III study OCEANIC-STROKE as planned base d on the recommendation of the IDMC, and are 
currently re-evaluating other indications in patients requiring antithrombotic treatment. 
In January 2024, we announced positive news relating to our drug candidate elinzanetant, which we are 
investigating as a non-hormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women. The pivotal 
Phase III OASIS 1 and 2 studies reached all of their pr imary and secondary endpoints. The results of the 
third PHASE III study OASIS 3 are expected in the first quarter of 2024. We plan to submit data from the OASIS 1, 2 and 3 studies to health authorities for approval of marketing authorizations for elinzanetant. 
Also in January 2024, we obtained marketing author ization in the European Union and Japan for Eylea™ 
8 mg (aflibercept 8 mg) for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) 
and diabetic macular edema (DME). Eylea™ 8 mg is th e only treatment that is approved in the EU for 
extended treatment intervals of up to five months in these indications.  
Sustainability 
In early May, we announced the signing of a long -term agreement with Cat Creek Energy (CCE), a 
renewable energy Independent Powe r Producer. The agreement will make  a significant contribution to 
reducing our carbon footprint in energy procurement, and lead to the construction by CCE of multiple 
variable renewable energy resources plus energy  storage facilities in the US state of Idaho.

2.1 Overview of Business Performance 77
Financing activities 
In May, we placed new senior bonds with a tota l volume of €3 billion. The issuance comprised three 
tranches and was multiple times covered. 
In September, we issued hybrid bonds with a total volume of €1.7 5 billion that were multiple times 
oversubscribed. The issuance comprised two tranches an d exclusively targeted inst itutional investors. The 
proceeds were used for various purposes, including financing a tender offer for two outstanding hybrid 
bonds. 
In November, we placed new bonds with a total volume  of US$5.75 billion (€5.3 billion). These were issued 
by our subsidiary Bayer US Finance LLC, United States, and guaranteed by  Bayer AG. The issuance 
comprised five tranches with maturities of between 3 and 30 years which were multiple times oversubscribed, and exclusively ta rgeted institutio nal investors. 
2.1.3 Economic Environment 
Global economic growth declines  
Global economic growth slowed to a low single-digit percentage in 2023. Major headwinds included the 
wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the growing fragme ntation of the world economy, high inflation rates 
and more restrictive monetary policy.  
Currency development 
In 2023, Group sales included negative currency effects of €1,964 million, and EBITDA before special 
items contained negative currency effects of €375 millio n. The effects pertained to the currencies shown in 
the following table.

2.2 Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group 79
Sales  
Sales  of the Bayer Group declined to €47,637 million (Fx & portfolio adj. –1.2%; re ported –6.1%) in 2023, 
with Germany accounting for €2,448 million of this figu re. We registered substantial negative currency 
effects of €1,964 million. 
Sales at Crop Science fell by 3.7% (Fx & portfolio ad j.) to €23,270 million, primar ily due to the decline in 
prices for our glyphosate-based products. Sales at Pharmaceuticals were level with the prior year, at 
€18,081 million (Fx & portfolio ad j. –0.4%). Significant gains fo r our new products Nubeqa™ and 
Kerendia™ and continued sales grow th for Eylea™ and our Radiology business were mainly offset by 
declines in China. Consumer Health posted a 6.3% increase in sales (F x & portfolio adj.) to €6,027 million, 
largely thanks to strong performance in the Derm atology and Pain & Cardio categories. In the 
Reconciliation, sales increased by 9.1%  (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €259 million. 
Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  of the Bayer Group fell 13.4% to €11,706  million (2022: €13,513 million). This 
figure included a negative currency effect of €375 millio n. At Crop Science, EBITDA before special items 
dropped by 26.6% to €5,0 38 million (2022: €6,867 m illion), largely due to the d ecline in prices for our 
glyphosate-based products. Earnings were also dimini shed by a mainly inflatio n-related increase in the 
cost of goods sold. At Pharmaceu ticals, EBITDA before special items was down by 11.6%, at 
€5,189 million (2022: €5,873 million). This was primaril y attributable to an un favorable product mix, 
inflation-driven cost increases, and higher R&D investments. Cons umer Health posted a 3.2% increase in 
EBITDA before special items to €1, 411 million (2022: €1,367 million), ma inly driven by our multi-year 
efficiency program, price management efforts and sust ained sales growth. In th e Reconciliation, EBITDA 
before special items came in at €68 million (2022: mi nus €594 million). Due to lowe r target attainment, the 
expense for the Group-wide  short-term incentive (STI) progam dec lined across all divisions, falling by 
around €1 billion overall. In additi on, the expense for the long-term incen tive (LTI) program recognized in 
the Reconciliation was around €0.4 billio n lower than in the previous year. 
EBITDA  came in at €10,632 million in  2023 (2022: €13,515 million). Depreciation, amortization, 
impairment losses and impairment loss reversals  led to net expense of €10,020 million (2022: 
€6,503 million). Of this amount, intangible assets  accounted for amortization, impairment losses and 
impairment loss reversals of €7,696 million (2022: €4,691 million), and proper ty, plant and equipment 
accounted for depreciation, impairme nt losses and impairment loss re versals of €2,324 million (2022: 
€1,812 million). Impairment losses and impairment lo ss reversals led to net expense of €6,111 million 
(2022: €2,554 million), with intangible assets acco unting for net expense of  €5,402 million (2022: 
€2,332 million). The impairment losses and impairment lo ss reversals were primarily attributable to the 
Crop Science Division (net impair ment losses of €6,082 million). 
A total of €5,905 million in impairment losses, net of im pairment loss reversals, were included in special 
items (2022: €2,226 million). There was zero acceler ated depreciation in 20 23 (2022: €4 million).  
EBIT before special items  declined by 18.0% to €7,589 million (2 022: €9,257 million). EBIT  amounted 
to €612 million in 2023 (2022: €7,0 12 million) after net special char ges of €6,977 million (2022: 
€2,245 million). The special charges mainly resulted from the aforeme ntioned impairment losses, which 
were primarily attributable to the Crop Science Division.

Core earnings per share 
Core earnings per share  decreased by a substantial 19.5% year on year to €6.39 (2022: €7.94) due to the 
decline in earnings in the Crop Scie nce and Pharmaceuticals divisions.  
Earnings per share (total)  amounted to minus €2.99 in 2023 (2 022: €4.22). The difference between this 
figure and the one for core earnings  per share is mainly due to the impa irment losses that were primarily 
attributable to the Cr op Science Division.

The cost of goods sold in 2023 was level with the prev ious year at €19,749 million (–0.6%), while the ratio 
of the cost of goods sold to total sales rose to 41.5% (2022: 39.2%). After adjusting for special items and currency effects, the cost of goods sold increased by 10 .1%. This was primarily due to higher raw material 
costs and inflation-related cost increases within th e Crop Science Division. 
Selling expenses decreased by 11.4% to €12,482 millio n and accounted for 26.2% (2022: 27.8%) of sales. 
After adjusting for special items and currency effects, selling expenses were down by 3.7%. This was 
mainly driven by Pharmaceuticals, where the decline was partly due to lower investment in marketing 
activities for our more mature product portfolio.  
Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased by 18.3% to €5,3 71 million, and the ratio of R&D 
expenses to sales came in at 11.3% (2022: 13.0%). Th is decrease resulted from lower special charges in 
the Crop Science and Pharmaceutical s divisions and from currency effect s. After adjusting for special 
items and currency effects, R& D expenses fell by 3.9%. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
2.2 Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group 82
General administration expenses fell by 13.6% to €2 ,453 million. The ratio of general administration 
expenses to total sales fell to 5.1% (2022: 5.6%). Adjusted for special items and currency effects, general 
administration expenses were 9.3% lower, mainly due to significantly lower ex pense for the Group-wide 
incentive programs.  
The balance of other operating expenses and other operating income came in at minus €6,970 million, 
representing a substantial deterioration against th e prior year (2022: minus  €362 million) that was 
predominantly due to impair ment losses on goodwill.  
Overall, all functional costs were diminished by th e lower expense for the Grou p-wide incentive programs. 
Financial result and income before income taxes 
After a financial result of minus €2,233 million (2022:  minus €2,342 million), income before income taxes 
amounted to minus €1,621 million (2022: €4,670 millio n). The improvement in the financial result was 
largely due to a net positive change in the fair value of financial invest ments and higher interest income 
from investments in particular. These effects were partly  offset by higher interest expense and negative 
currency effects related to the Argentinian peso.

Income taxes  
Income tax expense of €1,321 million was recorded  in 2023 (2022: €504 m illion). The year-on-year 
increase in tax expense was mainly due to a decline in deferred tax income arising from the recognition of 
temporary differences, tax loss and interest carryforwards, and tax credits. The decline in taxes 
paid/accrued reflected the company’ s general business performance.  
Net income  
After income tax expense and income attributable to noncontrolling interest, there was a net loss of 
€2,941 million in 2023 (2022: ne t income of €4,150 million). 
2.2.2 Business Development by Division 
Crop Science 
Market 
The global seed and crop protection market recorded  a decline (approximately –4%) in 2023, which was 
largely due to significantly lower glyphosate prices but pa rtially offset by growth in  the fungicides, corn and 
cereals segments. In addition, pressure on the market from generics and the continued high inflation and 
its impact on cost further exacerbated the difficult market environment for farmers worldwide and for Crop 
Science.

Sales 
Sales at Crop Science declined by 3.7% (Fx & port folio adj.) to €23,270 million in 2023, mainly due to 
lower prices for our glyphosate-based products as a result of reduced prices for generics. Amid an 
inflation-driven market environment,  the rest of our portfolio saw a positive price development overall, 
driven by innovative products  and higher commodity prices.

// Corn Seed & Traits  posted significant sales gains, primarily dr iven by price increases in all regions.  
// Sales at Herbicides  declined markedly due to lower prices for our glyphosate-based products across 
all regions. 
// Our Fungicides  business reported sales growth in all regions, mainly thanks to higher prices in 
Europe/Middle East/Africa and increased volumes in Latin and North America. However, volumes were 
down in Europe/Middle East/Africa and As ia/Pacific due to weat her-related factors. 
// Sales at Soybean Seed & Traits  were up, primarily driven by higher license revenues in Latin America. 
However, business was impacted by a decrease in  license revenues and lower planted acreages in 
North America.  
// Our Insecticides  business reported an increase in sales that wa s primarily attributable  to higher prices in 
Europe/Middle East/Africa. Lower volumes in Asia/P acific and North America were offset by increased 
volumes in Latin America in particular.  
// Sales at Cotton Seed  decreased sharply, mainly due to lowe r planted acreages in North America. 
// Business at Vegetable Seeds  developed positively thanks to price increases in all regions. 
// The reporting unit “ Other ” recorded a decrease in sales, with pr ices falling at the Industrial Turf & 
Ornamental (IT&O) unit but rising in the SeedGrowth business.  
Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  at Crop Science fell by 26.6% to €5,038 million in 2023 (2022: 
€6,867 million), mainly due to  significant price declines for our glyp hosate-based products. Earnings were 
also diminished by a mainly inflat ion-related increase in the cost of goods sold. By contrast, the expense 
for the Group-wide short-term incentive (STI) program declined due to the lower target attainment level. Insurance payouts for the loss of production in 2021 as a result of Hurricane Ida also had a positive 
impact. There was also a positive currency effect of  €103 million (2022: €284 m illion). The EBITDA margin 
before special items declined by 5.6 percentage points to 21.7%. 
EBIT  came in at minus €3,486 million in 2023 (2022:  €2,950 million) after net special charges of 
€6,034 million (2022: €1,460 million) that  primarily related to impairment  losses. There were impairment 
losses of €6,690 million on goodwill, largely due to an increase in the we ighted average cost of capital. A 
deterioration in business prospects and an inflation-driven rise in costs also had a negative impact. 
Impairment losses were also reco gnized in the cash-generating units  glyphosate (€562 million), due to a 
significant reduction in market pri ce expectations, and Cotton  Seed (€392 million), largely as a result of 
persistent competitive pressure.  
By contrast, impairment loss reversals were recorded  in the cash-generating units Soybean Seed & Traits 
(€988 million) and Corn Seed & Trai ts (€551 million). The impairment lo ss reversal for Soybean Seed & 
Traits largely pertained to the second  quarter, where reduced expectations  for the cost of goods sold as a 
result of decreased commodity prices had a positive impact. The impairment loss reversal for Corn Seed & 
Traits primarily related to the fourth quarter and wa s largely attributable to a decline in the weighted 
average cost of capital against the third quarter.

Fourth quarter of 2023 
Sales 
Sales advanced by 6.0% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €5,630 million in the fourth quarter, largely thanks to higher 
volumes in Latin and North America. Corn Seed & Traits  posted an increase in sa les, especially in North 
and Latin America, with growth mainly driven by higher prices. Business at Herbicides  was down, largely 
due to a fall in sales of glyphosate-based products as  lower prices were only partly offset by higher 
volumes. Fungicides  posted substantial growth, with business mainly up in Latin and North America due to 
increased volumes. Sales grew at Soybean Seed & Traits , primarily thanks to higher license revenues in 
Latin America. We recorded substantial gains at Insecticides , largely due to higher volumes in Latin 
America. Sales at Cotton Seed  declined by a double-digit percentage , mainly as a result of lower planted 
acreages in Asia/Pacific. Vegetable Seeds  posted higher sales in all regions, while business in the 
reporting unit “ Other ” was up, predominantly thanks to higher volumes. 
Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  rose by 30.5% to €1,070 million in the fourth quar ter (Q4 2022: €820 million), 
primarily due to insurance payouts fo r the loss of production in 2021 as a result of Hurricane Ida. By 
contrast, earnings were diminished by  an increase in costs, particularly  in the cost of goods sold, which 
was mainly due to high inflation. There was a positi ve currency effect of €24 m illion (Q4 2022: €64 million). 
The EBITDA margin before special items incr eased by 4.3 percentage  points to 19.0%. 
EBIT  increased to €975 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2022: €127 million) after  net special gains of 
€579 million (Q4 2022: net special char ges of €126 million) that related to net impairment loss reversals on 
intangible assets. We recorded impairment losses on goodwill (€633 million) that were mainly attributable 
to a deterioration in business prosp ects and an inflation-driven incr ease in costs. By contrast, we 
recognized impairment loss reversals in the cash-genera ting units Corn Seed & Tr aits (€1,130 million) and 
Soybean Seed & Traits (€65 million) that were largely due to a decline in the we ighted average cost of 
capital overall. 
Pharmaceuticals 
Market The pharmaceuticals market grew by around 9% in 2023. The World Heal th Organization declared the end 
of the COVID-19 pandemic on May 5, 2023, by which time at the latest focus had returned to preventing and treating diseases with the aid of existing and innovative products. Immunology, endocrinology and 
oncology were the growth drivers.

Sales 
Sales at Pharmaceuticals came in at €18,081 million in 20 23, and were therefore in line with the prior year 
(Fx & portfolio adj. –0.4%). We registered significant gains for our new products Nubeqa™ and 
Kerendia™, and also posted continued sales growth for Eylea ™ and our Radiology business. By contrast, 
we saw a significant drop in sales in  China, in part due to pandemic-rel ated developments at the start of 
the year and tender procedures for Adalat™. In addition, China’ s anti-corruption campaign in the 
healthcare sector indirectly had a negative impact  on demand in the second half of the year.

// As expected, sales of our oral anticoagulant Xarelto™  declined as a result of competitive and pricing 
pressure from generics, especially in China and th e United Kingdom. License revenues – recognized as 
sales – in the United States, where Xarelto™ is ma rketed by a subsidiary of  Johnson & Johnson, were 
down against the prior year. 
// Despite lower prices in Europe, we recorded encouraging sales gr owth for our ophthalmology drug 
Eylea™ , driven by higher volumes in all region s, particularly in Canada and Europe.  
// Sales of our cancer drug Nubeqa™  nearly doubled, with gains in all regions. The product therefore 
maintained its growth momentum, especially in the Un ited States and Europe, with significant increases 
in volumes. 
// We also achieved considerable gains with Kerendia™ , our product for the treatment of patients with 
chronic kidney disease associated with  type 2 diabetes, mainly thanks to  a substantial rise in volumes in 
the United States. 
// Sales of our Kogenate™/Kovaltry™/Jivi™  blood-clotting medicines fell significantly as a result of 
competitive pressure, particularly in the United States and China.  The declines for Kogenate™ and 
Kovaltry™ were only partly offset by gains for Jivi™. 
// Sales of our pulmonary hypertension treatment Adempas™  increased thanks to higher prices and 
volumes. As in the past, sales reflected the prop ortionate recognition of the upfront and milestone 
payments resulting from the sGC collabora tion with Merck & Co., United States. 
// Sales of Aspirin™ Cardio , our product for secondary prevention of heart attacks, and our cancer drug 
Stivarga™  fell markedly against a strong prior year, wi th business down in China in particular.  
// Our Radiology business, which includes CT Fluid Delivery, Ultravist™  and  Gadovist™ , continued to 
perform very well due to increased vo lumes and prices in all regions. 
Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  declined by 11.6% to €5 ,189 million in 2023. This was primarily due to an 
unfavorable product mix, inflation-dr iven cost increases, and higher R& D investments in our cell and gene 
therapy and chemoprote omics technologies, as well as in projects  in advanced clinical development. By 
contrast, earnings benefited from lower costs for market ing activities and, to a lesser extent, an increase in 
income from the sale of noncore businesses. Ther e was a negative currency effect of €221 million (2022: 
positive currency effect of €9 million). The EBITDA margin before special items declined by 1.8 percentage 
points to 28.7%.

Fourth quarter of 2023 
Sales 
Sales at Pharmaceuticals increased by  1.7% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €4 ,579 million in the fourth quarter. 
Significant gains for our new products Nubeqa™ and Ke rendia™ were mostly offset  by a decline in sales 
in China that was partly due to tender procedures  and the anticorruption cam paign in the country’s 
healthcare sector. 
Xarelto™  sales were down against the prior-year quarter,  mainly due to considerable declines in China. 
By contrast, we recorded encouraging gains for Eylea™  that were largely attributable to volume growth in 
Europe, Canada and China. Nubeqa™  sales increased significantly, wi th gains in all regions. Higher 
volumes in the United States and Europe had a particular ly positive impact on business. We also registered 
substantial gains for Kerendia™ , especially in the United States. The considerable increase in Adempas™  
sales was likewise driven primarily by gains in the United States. Sales of Kogenate™/Kovaltry™/Jivi™  fell 
as a result of competitive pressure, particularly in th e United States and China. The declines for Kogenate™ 
and Kovaltry™ were only partly offset by gains for Jivi™. We also recorded substantial declines for Aspirin™ 
Cardio  and Stivarga™ , with business primarily down in China. In addition, tender procedures in China 
weighed on Adalat™  sales. Our Radiology business, which includes CT Fluid Delivery, Ultravist™  and  
Gadovist™ , increased sales by a double-digit percenta ge thanks to higher volumes and prices. 
Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  fell by 11.7% to €1,266 million in  the fourth quarter (Q4 2022: 
€1,433 million). This was primarily due to higher R&D investments in our ce ll and gene therapy and 
chemoproteomics technologies, as well as in project s in advanced clinical development, along with 
inflation-driven cost increases. By  contrast, earnings benefited from a year-on-year increase in income 
from the sale of noncore businesses. There was a negative currency effect of €128 million (Q4 2022: 
€11 million). The EBITDA margin befo re special items declined by 1. 9 percentage points to 27.6%. 
EBIT  at Pharmaceuticals decreased by a substantial 34. 4% to €935 million after net special charges of 
€87 million (Q4 2022: net special gains of €282 million). The special charges primarily related to 
impairment losses resulting mainly  from extended development cycles  in ongoing projects, and to the 
measurement of contingent co nsiderations at fair value.

2.2 Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group 90
// Sales in the Europe/Middle East/Africa  region rose by a substantial 9.3% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to 
€1,967 million, with business up in all categories.  Growth was mainly driven by the Dermatology 
category, largely due to continued strong demand for Bepanthen™ and Canesten™. The Allergy & Cold category posted signif icant gains, with strong contributions from the Aspirin™ and Claritin™ product 
families. We also recorded double-digit percentage  growth at Pain & Card io, primarily thanks to 
Saridon™. Despite temporary supply constraints, the Digestive Heal th category saw continued sales 
growth, partly due to gains for Rennie™. 
// Sales in 
North America  were level with the prior year, at €2,352 million (Fx & portfolio adj. –0.9%). In the 
second half of the year, we encount ered a weaker market environment overall that was largely reflected 
in inventory reductions by our customers and more subdued consum er demand. This resulted in 
moderate declines in business in the Nutritionals, Digestive Health and Pain  & Cardio categories in 
particular. By contrast, our Allergy & Cold business po sted a slight increase in  sales against a strong 
prior year, mainly thanks to Afrin™. Sa les were also up at Dermatology.  
// Sales in Asia/Pacific  rose by 3.6% (Fx & portfo lio adj.) to €938 million. We posted significant growth in 
the Dermatology category that was partly driven by gains for our Kang Wang™ and Pi Kang Wang™ 
products, which are marketed in China. The Alle rgy & Cold, Pain & Cardio and Digestive Health 
categories also registered double-d igit percentage growth. Our Nutrit ionals business declined markedly, 
in part due to a weaker market envi ronment in China and Southeast Asia. 
// Sales in Latin America  increased by a strong 26.1% (Fx & portfo lio adj.) to €770 million, with growth in 
all categories. Business expanded part icularly strongly in the Pain & Cardio and Dermatology categories, 
with Actron™ and Bepanthen™ among the drivers. 
Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  rose by 3.2% to €1,411 million in 2023 (2022: €1,367 m illion), while the 
EBITDA margin before special items advanced by a substantial 0.9 percentage points to 23.4%. These 
increases were driven by our mult i-year efficiency program, successful  price management and sustained 
sales growth, which more than offset a strong rise in costs due to inflation as we ll as higher investments in

Fourth quarter of 2023 
Sales 
Sales at Consumer Health advanced  by a substantial 14.1% (Fx & port folio adj.) to €1,578 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2023, with gains in all regions and categories amid an improved  supply situation overall. 
We reported significant growth at Pain & Cardio, thanks to Actron™, and at Dermatology, driven by 
Bepanthen™. Sales also increased co nsiderably at Nutritionals and Digestive Health, partly due to gains 
for Elevit™ in Asia/Pacific and for MiraLAX™ in North America. We ag ain registered substantial sales 
increases for our cough and cold pr oducts, including the Aspirin™ product family, against a strong prior-
year quarter. Growth was particularly strong in Europe, driven by elevated cold incidence rates. In addition, 
sales of allergy prod ucts rose slightly.

EBITDA before special items  rose by 22.7% to €384 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 (Q4 2022: 
€313 million) thanks to the substant ial increase in sales as well as our successful cost and price 
management efforts. We achieved this growth in earning s despite a strong rise in  costs due to inflation as 
well as higher investments in mark eting our innovative products. Ther e was a negative currency effect of 
€41 million (Q4 2022: positive currency effect of €2 million). The EBITDA margin before special items 
increased by a substantial 3.8 percentage points to 24.3%. 
EBIT  at Consumer Health came in at €424 million (Q4  2022: €195 million) after  net special gains of 
€131 million (Q4 2022: special charges of €22 million) re lating primarily to impairment loss reversals that 
were largely attributable to a declin e in the weighted average cost of ca pital in the fourth quarter against 
the third quarter of 2023. By contrast, there we re special charges relating to restructuring.

3 24% on EBIT; based on historical average of tax rates 
4 At the divisional level, ROCE is compared with the WACC of the Bayer Group as we do not report WACC for the individual division s.  
Bayer’s ROCE in 2023 amounted to 0.7% (2022: 7.7%) and was therefore below the cost of capital 
(5.7%). Compared with the previous  year, ROCE fell at Crop Science and Pharmaceuticals but improved at 
Consumer Health. 
In the Crop Science Division, the decline in operating profit coupled with special charges from impairment 
losses resulted in negative EBIT and ROCE. The av erage capital employed also decreased due to the 
impairment losses; this effect was part ly offset by a decrease in provis ions for litigations due primarily to 
payments to resolve legal proceed ings, as well as by the increase in the capital base in 2022. 
At Pharmaceuticals, lower operating profit and higher special charges due to the absence of prior-year 
divestment gains resulted in a decline in EBIT, thus  yielding lower ROCE. ROCE was also diminished by 
the increase in the average capital employed that was partly due to milestone pa yments in connection with 
business combinations made in previous years and the decline in the respective liabilities.  
Consumer Health registered higher  EBIT, driven by increased operat ing profit and special gains from 
impairment loss reversals, and a stable capit al base, and therefore saw its ROCE improve.

2.2.4 Asset and Financial Po sition of the Bayer Group 
Financial management of the Bayer Group 
The financial management of the Bayer Group is co nducted centrally. Capital is a global resource, 
generally procured centrally and distributed within the Bayer Group. The foremost objectives of our 
financial management are to help bring about a sust ained increase in corporate value and to ensure the 
Group’s liquidity and creditworthi ness. This involves optimizing the capital structure and effectively 
managing risks. The management of currency, inte rest-rate, commodity-price and default risks helps to 
reduce the volatility of our earnings.  
The contracted rating agencies assess Bayer as follows:

2.2 Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group 93
These investment grade ratings from  all three agencies reflect the co mpany’s high solv ency and ensure 
access to a broad investor base for financing purposes. We have the ambition to reduce our financial debt 
considerably, to increase pr ofit and cash flow and to improve our cu rrent investment grade ratings toward 
the “A” category. 
As a matter of principle, we pursue a prudent debt ma nagement strategy to ensure  flexibility, drawing on a 
balanced financing portfolio. This is fundamentally ba sed on bonds in various currencies, syndicated credit 
facilities, bilateral loan agreements an d a global commercial paper program.  
We use financial derivatives to hedge against risk s arising from business operations or financial 
transactions but do not employ contracts in the absen ce of an underlying transact ion. It is our policy to 
diminish default risks by selecting trading partners with a high credit standi ng. We closely monitor the 
execution of all transactions, which are cond ucted in accordance with Group-wide policies.

Net cash provided by operating activities 
Net operating cash flow amounted to €5,117 million in  2023 (2022: 7,093 million) . Payments to resolve 
proceedings in the litigations surro unding dicamba, Essure™ and particularly PCBs and glyphosate led to 
a net outflow of €2,089 million (2022: €1,165 million) . That total comprised pa yments resulting from 
settlement agreements as well as court judgments. Ne t operating cash flow also included payments of 
€411 million (2022: €0 million) from banks from the tran sfer of trade receivables that were not yet due or 
settled by customers as of December 31, 2023. 
Net cash used in investing activities 
Net cash used in investing activities amounted to €3,517 million in 2023 (2022: €2,381 million). Cash 
outflows for proper ty, plant and equipment and intangible a ssets decreased to €2,751 million (2022: 
€2,949 million), with the decline mainly  attributable to the Crop Scien ce Division. Cash inflows from the 
sale of property, plant and equipm ent and other assets amounted to  €215 million (2022: €1,130 million). 
These inflows partly resulted from the sale of rights to our dermatological products A+D™, Solarcaine™, 
Cortate™ and Complex 15™ (€62 million) and our hormone replacem ent products Pr ogynova™ and 
Cyclo-Progynova™ (€68 million). Outf lows for noncurrent financial assets  amounted to €332 million (2022: 
€1,182 million). Of the high prior-y ear figure, €557 million was attributable to Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG 
and Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG drawing on their eff ective initial funds. Outflows for acquisitions, less 
acquired cash, amounted to €662 million (2022: €89 millio n) and largely related to  milestone payments in 
connection with the acquisition of US-based Asklep ios BioPharmaceutical, Inc. (AskBio) and Vividion 
Therapeutics, Inc., and the UK company Blackford Anal ysis Ltd. The net cash outflow for current financial 
assets came to €113 m illion (2022: €1,828 million), and primarily  pertained to investments in money 
market funds due to newly placed bonds.

€16 million), as well as in the expansion of fung icide production in Germany (around €25 million). 
Furthermore, an additional sum of around €23 millio n was invested in the expansion of corn seed 
production capacities in Ukraine (Pochuyki) in 2023. Alongside these projects, the development of digital 
solutions for our customers was a ke y investment in 2023 and will re main so in the coming years. 
At Pharmaceuticals , the largest expenditures for property, plan t, and equipment in 2023 were for cell and 
gene therapy research and production  facilities in the United States, Sp ain, Germany, the United Kingdom 
and Canada (around €132 million); modernization programs for the pr oduction network of our product 
supply organization at the sites in Turku, Finland; Leverkusen and Weimar, Germany; and Garbagnate, Italy 
(around €103 million); the construction of a new produc tion facility for solid launch products in Leverkusen, 
Germany (around €83 million); and the development of a multi-purpose fa cility in Wuppertal, Germany, for 
the production of active ingredients (around €42 million). Capital expenditur e for intangible assets included 
milestone payments to Hua Medicine (Shang hai) Co., Ltd., China (around €149 million). 
At approximately €26 million, Consumer Health ’s largest investment in 2023 was again the GMP16 upgrade 
program across its global production sites.

2.2 Earnings; Asset and Financial Position of the Bayer Group 96
The Bayer Group’s net financial debt  increased by €2.7 billion to €34.5 billion in 2023. Cash inflows from 
operating activities and positive currency effects were unable to fully offset the outflow for the dividend 
payment and the settlement payments for the litigations in the United States. 
Financial debt included seven subord inated hybrid bonds with a total vo lume of €4.9 billion, 50% of which 
is treated as equity by three contra cted rating agencies. As such, the hy brid bonds have a positive impact 
on the Group’s rating-sp ecific debt indicators. 
In 2023, Bayer AG placed new senior bonds with a t otal volume of €3 billio n under its Debt Issuance 
Program. The three tranches with volumes of €750 million, €750 million and €1.5 billion have maturities of 
3.25 years, 6.25 years and 10 years, respectively. The coupons of the notes are 4.000%, 4.250% and 4.625%, respectively. Bayer AG also repurchased €1.4 billion in hybrid bonds maturing in 2074 (callable 
on July 1, 2024) and 2079 (callable on February 12, 2025) before the first call date. To finance the 
repurchase, new hybrid bonds with a total volume of  €1.75 billion were placed. The two tranches have a 
final maturity of 60 years. The firs t tranche in the amount of €750 m illion with a noncall period of 5.25 
years pays a coupon of 6.625%. The second tranche in  the amount of €1.0 billion with a noncall period of 
8.25 years pays a coupon of 7.000%. 
In addition, Bayer US Finance LLC, United States , placed bonds with a volume of US$5.75 billion 
(€5.3 billion). The five tranches with maturities of 3, 5.2, 7, 10 and 30  years have volumes of US$1.0 billion 
(€0.9 billion), US$1.0 billion (€0.9 billion), US$1.25 b illion (€1.2 billion), US$1.75 billion (€1.6 billion), and 
US$0.75 billion (€0.7 billion) and coupons of 6.125%, 6.250%, 6.375%, 6.500% and 6.875%, respectively. 
Furthermore, two bonds with a total volume of US$3.5 b illion (€3.2 billion) and one bond with a volume of 
€500 million were redeemed at maturity in 2023. 
The decline in liabilities to banks was attributable to the repayment of the €3 billion credit facility drawn in 
May 2022.  
Other financial liabilities increased, primaril y due to the issuance of commercial paper.

2.3 Alternative Performance Measures Used by the Bayer Group 97
Between December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023,  total assets decreased  by €8.6 billion to 
€116.3 billion. 
// Noncurrent assets fell by €8.4 b illion to €78.7 billion in 2023, mainly  due to the impairment losses and 
impairment loss reversals recorded during the year  (net effect of –€7.7 billion) and foreign currency 
effects impacting goodwill and intang ible assets (–€1.4 billion). 
// Total current assets declined by  €0.2 billion to €37.6 billion. The primary factors here included the 
reduction in trade accounts receivable as a result of intensified receiva bles management (–€1.0 billion), 
and the increase in cash and cas h equivalents (+€0.7 billion). 
// Equity decreased by €5.8  billion during the year to €33.1 billion. The main  factors here included 
the income after income taxes (–€2.9 billion), the dividend payment (–€2.4 billion), currency translation 
of equity items (–€0.7 billion), and changes – recogn ized outside profit or loss – arising from the 
remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (+€0 .3 billion). The equity ra tio fell to 28.5% (2022: 
31.2%). 
// Liabilities declined by €2.8 bil lion to €83.2 billion. Other liabilitie s were diminished by settlement 
payments in connection with th e PCB litigations in January 2023 (–€1.2 billion). Miscellaneous 
provisions declined by €2 .7 billion overall, reflecting effects of –€0. 9 billion for litigatio ns, –€0.9 billion for 
variable, performance-related one-time payments to  employees, –€0.4 billion for stock programs and  
–€0.4 billion for restructuring. In addition, there wa s a decline in miscellaneous liabilities for milestone 
payments in connection with the acquisition of US companies Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc. 
(AskBio), BlueRock Therapeutics LP (BlueRock) and Vividion Therapeutics, Inc. (–€0.6 billion). 
Furthermore, provisions fo r pensions decreased due to a change in  discount rates and the development 
of plan assets (–€0.4 billion). Financial liabilities incr eased by €3.3 billion overall. The main factors here 
included the issuance of new bonds (+US$5.75 billion bonds, +€3.0 billion senior bonds and 
+€1.75 billion hybrid bonds), the repayment of bond s (–€3.7 billion for bonds redeemed at maturity;  
–€1.4 billion for hybrid bonds repurchased before th e first call date), the increase in commercial paper 
(+€1.8 billion) and the repayment of the cr edit line drawn in May 2022 (–€3.0 billion).  
// Supply chain financing programs (also known as reve rse factoring) are used in the Bayer Group that 
enable suppliers to choose to have individual invoi ces paid prior to their due date. As part of such 
programs, the supplier concludes a financing agreem ent with a bank or platform operator without 
Bayer’s involvement and, upon request, is paid th e invoice amount by the bank in advance less an 
interest component. Bayer genera lly pays the invoice am ount to the bank when due; the payment 
deadlines lie within the usual scope for the indu stry. Bayer has assessed these programs based on 
various criteria and concluded that the associated  liabilities retain the character of trade accounts 
payable. The related payments to the bank are ther efore classified as a cash outflow from operating 
activities. 
2.3 Alternative Performance Measures Used 
by the Bayer Group 
The Combined Management Report and the Consolidated Financial St atements of the Bayer Group are 
prepared according to the applicable financial report ing standards. In addition  to the disclosures and 
metrics these require, Bayer publishes alternative pe rformance measures (APMs) that are not defined or 
specified in these standards and for which there are no generally accepted reporting formats. Bayer 
calculates APMs to enable a comparison of performan ce indicators over time an d against those of other 
companies in its industry sectors. These APMs are cal culated by making certain adjustments to items in 
the statement of financial position or the income st atement prepared according to the applicable financial 
reporting standards. Such adjust ments may result from differences in calculation or measurement 
methods, nonuniform business activities or special fact ors affecting the information value of these items. 
The APMs determined in this way apply to all pe riods and are used both internally for business 
management purposes and externally by analysts, in vestors and rating agencies  to assess the company’s 
performance. Bayer determines the following APMs:  // Change in sales (reported,  currency-adjusted, currency-  and portfolio-adjusted) 
// EBITDA  
// EBITDA before special items 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
2.3 Alternative Performance Measures Used by the Bayer Group 98
// EBITDA margin before special items 
// EBIT 
// EBIT before special items 
// Clean depreciation and amortization  
// Core earnings per share  
// Net financial debt 
// Return on capital employed (ROCE) 
// Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) 
// Capital employed 
// Weighted average cost  of capital (WACC) 
// Free cash flow 
// Forecast key financial data 
The (reported) change in sales  is a relative indicator. It shows the percentage by which sales varied from 
the previous year.  
The currency-adjusted or currency- and portfolio-adjusted change in sales  shows the percentage change 
in sales excluding the impact of exchange rate effect s and, in the latter case, disregarding material 
acquisitions and divestments as well. Exchange rate effects are generally calculated on the basis of the 
functional currency valid in the respective country. An exception existed in Argentin a, primarily in our crop 
protection business, where the currency effect was calcula ted on the basis of the US dollar instead of the 
functional currency.  
EBITDA  (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) encompa sses earnings before the 
financial result, taxes, depr eciation and impairment losses  / loss reversals on property, plant and 
equipment, impairment losses on goodwill,  and amortization an d impairment losses/  loss reversals on other 
intangible assets. This performance indicator neutra lizes the effects of the financial result along with 
distortions of operational performance that result from divergent depreciation and amortization methods and the exercise of measurement discretion. EBITDA is EBIT plus the amortization of intangible assets and the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, plus impairment losses and minus impairment loss 
reversals, recognized in profit or  loss during the reporting period.  
EBIT  (earnings before interest and taxes) serves to pr esent a company’s performance while eliminating the 
effects of differences between local taxation systems and different financing activities.  
EBITDA before special items  and EBIT before special items  show the development of the operational 
business irrespective of the effects of special items, i. e., special effects for the Bayer Group with regard to 
their nature and magnitude. These ma y include acquisition costs, divest ments, litigations, restructuring, 
integration costs, impairment losses and impairment loss reversals. In the calculation of EBIT before 
special items and EBITDA before special items, speci al charges are added and special gains subtracted. 
Clean depreciation and amortization exclude the effect of (correspon ding) special items on the 
depreciation and amortization figures.  
The EBITDA margin before special items  is a relative indicator used by  Bayer for internal and external 
comparisons of operational earnings performance. It is the ratio of EBITDA before special items to net sales.  
The APM 
core earnings per share (core EPS)  from continuing operations is based on the concept of 
earnings per share (EPS) as defined in IAS 33.   
Core EPS  is calculated using the following method: Base d on EBIT (as per the income statements), the 
special items, impairment losses on goodwill, amortization  / impairment losses/  loss reversals on other 
intangible assets, impairment losses  / loss reversals on property, plant and equipment and the accelerated 
depreciation included in special items are neutralized to determine core EBIT . This enables a comparison 
of performance over time. Core EBIT is reconciled to core net income from continuing operations . This is  
calculated by adding the core financial result to core  EBIT. Special items in the financial result include 
nonrecurring financial expenses or income that are not part of our normal financing activities. These 
primarily pertain to changes in the fair value of equity  instruments that are not held for medium- or long-

term strategic purposes, as well as to nonrecurring fina ncial expenses or income arising from acquisitions, 
divestments and litigations. Income taxes – net of special items – are then deducted from this figure to give 
core net income. Special items relating to income ta xes include material effects from tax reforms, among 
other things. 
Core EPS is then calculated by dividing core net income by the weighted av erage number of shares.  
As core EPS is calculated for each interim reporting peri od, core EPS for the fiscal year or for each interim 
reporting period up to the respective closing date may deviate from the cumulated core EPS for the 
individual interim reporting periods. 
Net financial debt  is an important financial management indi cator for the Bayer Group and is used both 
internally and externally in as sessing its liquidity, capital stru cture and financial flexibility.  
The return on capital  employed (ROCE)  measures the capital return ov er a specified period and is 
employed as a strategic indicator to eval uate value creation. It is the ratio of net operating profit after 
taxes (NOPAT)  to the average capital employed  in a fiscal year. NOPAT is  calculated by subtracting 
income taxes from EBIT. Income taxes are calculated by multiplying EBIT by a uniform tax rate that is 
based on a historical average of tax rates. 
The capital employed  by Bayer is the total carrying amount of operational noncurrent and current assets, 
minus liabilities that are largely non- interest-bearing in character and/or would distort the capital base. An 
average value, calculated from the values at the end of  the prior year and of the reporting year, is used to 
depict the change in capital empl oyed during the reporting year.  
The ROCE is compared to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) , which is the return expected by 
the providers of equity and debt. If the ROCE exceeds the WACC, return expectations have been 
exceeded, indicating that value has been created. 
The WACC is based on an after-tax approach and calculated at the star t of the year as the weighted 
average of the equity and debt cost  factors. The cost of equity is determined using the capital asset 
pricing model (CAPM), while the debt-capital cost facto r is calculated based on th e average returns of ten-
year Eurobonds issued by industrial companies. Furth er information on the segm ent-specific capital cost 
factors used in impairment testing is provided in Note [4] to B Co nsolidated Financial Statements. 
Free cash flow (FCF)  is an alternative performance measure that  is based on the cash flow from operating 
activities under IAS 7. FCF illustrates  the cash flows available for paying  dividends and reducing debt as 
well as for investing in innovation  and acquisitions. It is calculate d by subtracting cash outflows for 
additions to property, plant and equipment and intang ible assets from the cash flow from operating 
activities from continuing and disc ontinued operations, adding interest  and dividends received along with 
interest received from interest-rate swaps, and dedu cting interest paid incl uding interest-rate swaps. 
The forward-looking key performa nce indicators published in the  forecast for key financial data  are based 
on data that is determined in the course of our planning process. The key financial data in the forecast is 
determined in accordance with the applied accounting policies and with the calculation models for 
alternative performance measures described in this chapter.

3. Report on Future Perspectives 
and on Opportunities and Risks 
3.1 Future Perspectives 
3.1.1 Economic Outlook 
World economic growth impacted by crises 
Based on data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we expect the global economy to expand by a 
low single-digit percentage in 202417, with this below-average growth rate broadly on a par with 2023. 
Ongoing crises and wars will likely continue to weig h on the global economy, as will more restrictive 
monetary and fiscal policies. 
We expect the global seed and crop protection  market to recover in 2024, with moderate growth of 
approximately 2%18 (2022: approximately –4%). Prices for ag rochemical products, including glyphosate, 
are expected to stabilize an d gradually return to normal levels. The continued organic growth of the crop 
protection segments, especially insect icides, is driving the growth of the overall crop protection market. 
The positive development anticipated in the seeds an d traits segment will likely be driven by acreage 
increases in corn and soybeans, particularly in Latin America, with further grow th coming from vegetable 
seeds and cereals. The potential impact s of current geopolitical events and disruptions will require further 
analysis. 
We expect the pharmaceuticals market  to expand by approximately 7%19 in 2024 (2023: +9%). Innovative 
products will continue to drive growth and more than offset losses due to the expiration of patents. 
However, uncertainty remains over how heavily the pharmaceuticals market  will be impacted by external 
factors such as the war in Ukraine, inflatio nary pressure and health system reforms. 
At around 5%20, we anticipate that growth of the consumer health market  in 2024 will roughly be on a par 
with the 2023 level (+5%) as economic and pricing co nditions stabilize and upper respiratory conditions 
continue to resume historical patterns. 
3.1.2 Corporate Outlook  
The following forecast is based on  the current business developmen t and our internal planning. To 
enhance the comparability of operational performan ce, we are also presenting this guidance on a 
currency-adjusted basis, applying the av erage monthly exchange rates from 2023. 
Overall, it should be noted that a 1% appreciation (d epreciation) of the euro ag ainst all other currencies 
would decrease (increase) sales by some €400 million on an annual basis.

3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 
3.2.1 Group-wide Opportunity and Risk Management System 
As a global life science enterprise, we are exposed to a wide range of internal and external developments 
and events that could significantly impact the achievement of our financial and nonfinancial objectives. 
Opportunity and risk management is therefore an in tegral part of corporate management at Bayer. 
We regard opportunities as positive deviations, and ri sks as negative deviations, from projected or target 
values for potential future developments. We augment our risk definition process by also taking into 
account any potential adverse effects th at our business operations could have on people and/or the 
environment.  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 102
Opportunity management system 
We identify opportunities as part of the annual planning cycle, during which we analyze internal and 
external factors that may affect our business. These may be factors of a social, economic or environmental 
nature, for example. Our planning pr ocess starts with a comprehensive an alysis of the markets. We build 
on this by analyzing the respectiv e market environments to identify  opportunities. These analyses are 
based on different time periods since trends or deve lopments may impact our business over the short, 
medium or long term. In addition, we identify and le verage opportunities as part of our regular business 
operations and through our daily observation of internal processes and markets. Depending on developments, factors affecting our business, such as market risks,  may result in either risks or 
opportunities.  
Risk management system 
We have implemented a holistic and integrated risk ma nagement system designed to ensure the continued 
existence and future target attainment of the Gr oup through the early iden tification, assessment and 
treatment of risks.  
Our risk management system is alig ned to internationally recognized st andards and principles such as the 
ISO 31000 risk management standard of the International Organization for Standardization, and is defined and implemented with the help of binding corporate policies.

The Board of Management  of Bayer AG holds overall responsib ility for an effective risk management 
system. It examines the appropriat eness and effectiveness of the risk ma nagement system at least once a 
year, as does the Supervis ory Board’s Audit Committee. In addition, a corresponding report is provided to 
the full Supervisory Board. 
The Bayer Assurance Committee  is chaired by the Chief Financia l Officer, with a second Board of 
Management member participating on a rotating basis.  Besides ensuring that ap propriate action is taken 
to control any substantial risks, th e Bayer Assurance Committee regularl y discusses and reviews the risk 
portfolio and the status of the risk control measures. 
Responsibility for the identificati on, assessment, treatment and re porting of risks lies with the operational 
business units  in the divisions and enabling functions. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 103
Enterprise risk management (ERM), including risk early warning system 
Our enterprise risk management (ERM) system meets the requirement set out in Section 91, Paragraph 2 
of the German Stock Corporation Act that a risk early warning system be implemented and used to 
identify, at an early stage, develo pments that are material and/or co uld endanger the company’s continued 
existence. It establishes a consistent framework and uniform standards for the risk early warning system 
throughout the Bayer Group. 
The Enterprise Risk Management department steers and coordinates said risk management system. It 
provides overarching standards, methods and tools, is  responsible for the risk early warning system, steers 
the annual ERM process and works on ensuring cont inuous monitoring and improvement. For further 
details, see 3.2.1 “Basic elements of the Bayer risk  management system,” and specifically “ERM: risk 
management process” and “ERM: monitoring and improvement.” The ERM department also ensures 
reporting to the Bayer Assurance Committee, the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board and the 
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.  
Internal control system for (Group) accounting and financial reporting 
(Report pursuant to Section 289, Paragraph 4 and Section 315, Paragraph 4 of the German Commercial Code) 
As part of the comprehensive risk management system, we have an internal cont rol system over financial 
reporting (ICSOFR) in place for th e (Group) accounting and financial re porting process. This system 
comprises suitable structures and workflows th at are defined and implemented throughout the 
organization. The purpose of ou r ICSOFR is to ensure proper and effective accounting and (Group) 
financial reporting in accordance with the relevant reporting principles. The ICSOFR is designed to 
guarantee timely, uniform and accura te accounting for all business transactions based on applicable 
statutory regulations, accounting and financial report ing standards, and the inte rnal Group policies that 
are binding on all consolidated companies. Risk s are identified and assessed, and appropriate 
countermeasures are taken to mitigate them. Manda tory Group-wide standards such as system-based 
and manual reconciliation processes an d functional separation have been  derived from these frameworks 
and promulgated throughout the Bayer Group. Thes e standards are implemented by the Bayer Group 
companies. Compliance with these standards is the responsibility of the resp ective management teams. 
However, it should be noted that an internal control system, irrespective of its design, cannot provide absolute assurance that material misstatements in th e financial reporting will be avoided or identified.  
Compliance management system  
Our compliance management system is aligned to the company’s risk status and aims to ensure lawful 
and responsible conduct by our employees. It is design ed to identify potential violations in advance and 
systematically prevent their occurre nce. The compliance management syst em thus contributes significantly 
to the integration of compliance into our operating units and their processes. Detailed information on the compliance management system can be found in Chapter A 4.2 “Compliance,” which describes in 
particular the process of identifying risks and taking measures to mitigate them. 
Independent internal and external monitoring 
The Internal Audit department conducts independent, risk-based and objective audit activities, employing 
a targeted and systematic approach in order to a ssess and help improve the effectiveness of corporate 
governance, risk management and moni toring processes. The tasks, powers  and responsibilities of Internal 
Audit, as well as its position within the Bayer Group, are defined and established in the rules of procedure. 
The department’s management adheres to the mandator y elements of the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditi ng of the Institute of Internal Audi tors (IIA). The Ch ief Audit Executive 
(CAE) regularly reports to the Board of Manageme nt and the Audit Committee on Internal Audit’s 
compliance with the code of ethics and the standard s. The CAE also regularly reports to the Board of 
Management and Audit Committee on the results of th e audit assignments, as well as, for example, on 
Internal Audit’s quality as surance and improvement program. This includes aspects such as relevant 
results of internal and external assessments carried out at least on ce every five years by a qualified 
independent assessor. The most recen t assessment was concluded in the fo urth quarter of 2022, yielding 
the best results possible. In additi on, the fundamental suitability of the early warning system is assessed by 
the external auditor as an independent external body as part of its audit of the annual financial statements.

3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 104
Basic elements of the Bayer risk management system 
Risk culture and objectives of the risk management system 
All levels of the company are included in risk ma nagement in order to heighten the awareness and 
understanding of risks. This lays the foundation fo r a risk culture with independent, proactive and 
systematic risk management involv ing clearly defined roles and respon sibilities, principles, standards, 
methods, tools and training measures. The aims of  the risk management system are to achieve risk 
transparency, which also encompasse s the early detection of risks, to support risk-based (treatment) 
decisions and to ensure complian ce with legal requirements.  
ERM: risk management process 
Identification:  Risks are identified by risk owners in the divisions and enabling functions. To help ensure 
we identify risks as comprehensivel y as possible, we maintain a risk universe that reflects the company’s 
potential risk categories. The Bayer Risk Universe, wh ich is regularly updated, also expressly accounts for 
risks of a nonfinancial nature th at are linked to our business activity or to our business relationships, 
products and services. Risks pursuant to the Corporate Social Respon sibility (CSR) Directive 
Implementation Act that relate to environmental, empl oyee and social issues, human rights, corruption and 
bribery (compliance) are included as well. Further in formation on the nonfinanci al statement can be found 
in the “About this Report” section. 
Assessment:  Where possible, the identified risks are evalua ted with regard to their potential impact and 
likelihood of occurrence using the matrix below. Risk s are assessed on a net basis, taking into account the 
risk control measures in place to mitigate the pote ntial impact and/or likelihood of occurrence.

Risks are classified as high, medium or low when assessi ng their materiality within the overall risk portfolio. 
The extent of the impact is rated in quantitative and/or qualitative terms. The quantitative assessment 
reflects a potentially negative effect on cash flows. A qualitative assessment of the impact is based on 
criteria such as the effect on our st rategy or reputation, the potential loss of stakeholder confidence, and 
potential impact on people and/or the environment. The higher rating – qualitatively or quantitatively – determines the overall assessment. The likelihood of occurrence is calculated based on a maximum period 
of 10 years.  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 105
We aggregate risks to ensure the early detection of ri sks that could combine or correlate to potentially 
endanger our company’s continued existence. Usin g methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, we 
estimate the potential aggregated impact that our main risks could have on our cash flow. We compare 
the resulting aggregated risk situation with th e risk-bearing capacity appr oved by the Board of 
Management. The outcome of this comparison is factored into the Board of Management’s overall 
assessment of the company’s risk status.  
Treatment:  The risk owners decide on a targeted risk le vel based on a cost-benefit analysis and define a 
risk management strategy as well as risk manageme nt measures. These include risk avoidance, risk 
reduction, risk transfer and risk acceptance.  
Reporting:  The results are reported to the Bayer A ssurance Committee by the Enterprise Risk 
Management department within the Internal Audit & Risk Management enabling function. In addition, new 
risks above a defined threshold are re ported to Enterprise Risk Management on an ad-hoc basis and, if 
relevant, to the Bayer Assurance Committee. A report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board at least once a year. 
ERM: monitoring and improvement 
The Enterprise Risk Management department within the Internal Audit & Risk Management enabling 
function continuously evaluates whether the principl es, standards, methods and tools are appropriate and 
up to date.  
Assessment of the risk management and internal cont rol systems pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 3 of 
the German Stock Corporation Act  
The overarching requirements for all management syst ems in place at Bayer are defined by the integrated 
management system (IMS). Controls and monitoring are generally performed as part of the respective 
management systems, focusing on the risks that need to be mitigated. 
The Board of Management has defined and impl emented a procedure to ensure compliance with 
requirements pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act with regard to the risk management system and the inte rnal control system. This  procedure is regularly reviewed and further 
developed as required. 
Accordingly, the Board of Management is focused particularly on the four management systems of 
enterprise risk management, internal control sy stem for (Group) accounting and financial reporting 
processes, compliance, and internal  audit. These four management sy stems form the core of our risk 
management and internal control systems. 
For further information on the core management syst ems, see Chapter 3.2.1 and particularly “Enterprise 
risk management (ERM) including risk early warning system,” “ERM: risk management process” and “ERM: 
monitoring and improvement,” “Int ernal control system for (Group) accounting and financial reporting 
processes” and “Compliance management system,” as well as Chapter 4.2 “Compliance” and Chapter 
3.2.1, particularly “Independent internal and external monitoring.”  
These core management systems are regularly monito red and reviewed by means of audits within the 
respective management system and au dits by Internal Audit and/or exte rnal auditors. The results of these 
reviews are regularly reported to the Board of Management. 
The review by the Board of Management did not identi fy any relevant indications  that, in their entirety, 
would call into question the appropriatenes s and effectiveness of these systems for 2023.   
However, it is important to bear in mind that, irrespec tive of their design or evaluation, risk management 
and internal control systems cannot ensu re with absolute certainty that a ll risks are identified before they 
materialize and that the envisaged controls uncover all weaknesses. 
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 106
3.2.2 Opportunity and Risk Status  
In this section, we report on material, reportable  risks pursuant to German Accounting Standard No. 20. 
These include all financial and nonfinancial risks that have been classified as high or medium and are at 
least significant in terms of potential impact after taking into account the risk control measures in place 
(net risk). They encompass risks falling within the black outline in th e rating matrix A 3.2.1/2. In addition, 
we report relevant risks that (from a financial poin t of view) may not be sufficiently or meaningfully 
assessable, if at all. We also report  on the principal opportunities identified in the course of our opportunity 
management. Furthermore, we assess the probability that th e effects of individual risks could change 
significantly during the forecast peri od. Our most recent evaluation did no t find this to be case, with the 
following exception: Legal proceedings may generally involve substantial estimation risks. Against the 
background of the proceedings in the glyphosate matter and PCB matters, in particular, outcomes of mediation and/or the ongoing litigations may lead to adjustments of the pr ovisions established in 
connection with these series of lit igations. Such adjustments may mate rially impact the forecast issued 
with respect to the financial position and cash flows.  See also Note [30] in B Consolidated Financial 
Statements. 
Comparable risks existing in differ ent divisions of the company are gr ouped together where applicable.  
According to our understanding, risks relating to the as pects outlined in the CSR Directive Implementation 
Act that would have to be reported separately would have to have at least a “severe” potential impact under the qualitative criter ion “potential impact on people and/or the environment,” and additionally their 
likelihood of occurrence would have to be classified as “very likely.” We did not iden tify any risks that meet 
said criteria in 2023. 
The section below details the individual  risk categories that fall within the “Risks to be reported externally” 
area outlined in the risk matrix, as well as how they have been classified
21 and the divisions concerned. 
The order in which the risks are listed does not im ply any order of importance. We also describe 
opportunities and risks of a division-specific nature where relevant. The division s mentioned are those that 
have identified material risks. Other divisions may also be affected to a lesser extent. Material risks 
reported by enabling functions are cat egorized under “Group,” although they may also affect the divisions. 
Social and macroeconomic trends  
(High: Group; Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals)  
We continue to see the risk of geopolitical shifts  and tensions that may im pact our global business. 
Competition between global powers and geostrategic rivalries are calling established economic paradigms 
into question and may adversely impact  investment decisions, supply chai ns and international trade flows. 
While global trade remains highly interconnected, glob alization is undergoing a period of transition that 
may have ramifications for our busi ness environment: Decoupling in vari ous areas (e.g. capital markets, 
technological standards) is causin g many states to become increasin gly focused on securing access to 
critical commodities and strategically  important technologies. This may lead to the introduction of a greater 
number of restrictive commercial measur es or investment contro ls relating to critical infrastructure, which 
may impact us directly or indirectly. Geopolitical risks continue to relate primarily to Russia’s war in 
Ukraine. We see risks both directly for our producti on and customers, as well as indirectly through the 
impact on our suppliers and supply chains (see also the “Supply of products” s ection). The effects of wars 
– including imposed sanctions – generally have the po tential to significantly impact financial markets and 
economies, leading, for example, to pressure on suppl y chains, high volatility of foreign exchange rates 
and energy prices, inflation and th e related cost pressure, as well as  an economic slowdown or even 
recession. Shifts in these underlying conditions may ne gatively impact our sales and margins, for example. 
Furthermore, our market environment and, conseque ntly, our business perfor mance may be adversely 
impacted. The environment in which we operate is  becoming increasingly harsh overall, which may 
continue to lead to increased attacks on critical infrastructure. We are preparing for these challenges with 
global and local operational crisis management, task fo rces and other interdisciplinary teams, as well as by 
diversifying our energy sources.  
 
21 The classification pertains to the risks. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 107
The growing world population, coupled with rising fo od demand, gives rise to opportunities for our Crop 
Science Division. In addition, chan ging consumption patterns and in creasing public awareness of the 
importance of healthy eating and sustai nability, paired with new digital technologies, are giving rise to new 
pools of value in the agriculture market. Therefore, wh ile high-quality seeds and crop protection will remain 
at our core, we see opportunities to capture additional value by tapping new customer segments, sales platforms and digital capabilities.  
Furthermore, the aging population gi ves rise to opportunities for our Pharmaceuticals Division, with the 
incidence of chronic diseases on the rise and an increasing number of patients suffering from multiple 
conditions affecting their quality of life. To address the growing demand for innovative healthcare products 
to treat age-related diseases, our Pharmaceuticals Division has stream lined its R&D activities toward 
precision medicine with a narrower therapeutic area focus but a wider range of modalities.  
Moreover, a negative public perception of Bayer re presents a risk. For example, modern agricultural 
methods, such as the application of certain classes of crop protection products and the use of biotechnology, are often the subject of intense public  debate, which may adversely affect our reputation. 
The risk of an increasingly negative public debate that  is not primarily based on science may, for example, 
lead to legislative and regulatory decisions that are unfavorable to our company,  significantly limiting the 
use of our products or even resulting in voluntary or mandated product withdrawals. We are engaged in 
constant dialogue with interest groups and regula tors to promote scientifically founded, rational and 
responsible discussions and d ecision-making processes.  
Furthermore, negative developments of a macroecono mic nature, such as crises in important sales 
markets for our company, could we igh on our business and reduce ou r earnings. Our seed and crop 
protection business in particular is  cyclical and shaped by economic developments and factors, including 
fluctuating weather conditions and pest pressure that may adversely impact our Crop Science business. 
Forecasts concerning climate change indicate that these risks may possib ly increase in the long term. We 
address these influences through ou r globally diversified business, flexible supply chain, comprehensive 
monitoring and assessment of market developments, and our ability to adjust production volumes to the 
level of demand forecast in sa les and distribution planning. 
Market developments (Medium: Crop Science) 
In the Crop Science Division, we could face increas ed competition in the seed and crop protection 
industry. The successful market launch of new generati ons of products is also subject to external factors 
that we have only limited control over. In addition, new co mpetitors entering the market and aggressive 
marketing and pricing strategies – not only for generic products – could have a largely negative impact on 
our profitability and market position. In  addition, increasing digitalization in  the agriculture sector could lead 
to the rise of new players and alter the market. To take account of thes e developments, we are realigning 
our business models, engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships, and utilizing our own R&D 
capabilities.  
We see opportunities for our Pharmaceu ticals Division. Scientific breakthro ughs in fields such as cell and 
gene therapy and precision medicine have expanded th e toolbox of innovative therapies. This provides 
opportunities to cure patients with the highest unmet n eeds or even prevent diseases in the first place. At 
the same time, data science and AI are leading to im proved diagnostic methods,  enabling diseases to be 
diagnosed and treated in a more targeted way.

Regulatory changes (High: Group; Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals) 
Our business activity is subject to extensive regulati ons that continue to develop and may become more 
stringent, including in certain cases for reasons of a political nature. For example, further restrictions could 
be imposed on the sale and use of various crop protection products. In addition, approvals that have already been granted are currently being challenged and will likely cont inue to be challenged in court, 
especially by NGOs, potentially resulting in temporar y or permanent revocation of  product registrations or 
approvals and financial loss from reduced sales of cr op protection products as well as associated seed 
offerings. Conserving biodiversity is  one of the topics at hand in this  respect, together  with potential 
restrictions on the manufacture and use of certain ch emical substances. Approv al conditions may also 
become even more challenging for the Pharmaceuticals Division. In addition, the pricing of pharmaceutical 
products could become more strictly regulated – not only for products already exposed to generic competition, but also for innovative, patent-protect ed products. Residues of agrochemical products, 
pharmaceutical compounds or microplastics in the environment could also become subject to more 
stringent regulation. In addition, re gulatory changes could affect agricult ural imports from other parts of 
the world and therefore our business in those regions. We also need to prepare for regulatory changes in 
the field of AI in the future. Regu latory changes could also cause uncer tainty over our products’ patent 
protection, potentially resu lting in financial losses that may even  include the repayment of license fees. 
Regulatory changes may also lead to higher product development costs and longer development times, or 
even necessitate adjustments to our product portfolio, which in turn may negatively impact our reputation.  
We counter such risks by monitoring changes in regula tory requirements in orde r to adequately address 
them within the company. We pursue a global strategy that bundles our strong product portfolio and sustainability commitments, and leverages our global business presence. We also  deploy in-house R&D 
capacities, make acquisitions and enter into collaborations, while aligning our product portfolio to reflect 
anticipated changes. We also addre ss these risks by engaging in dialogue with the authorities with the 
goal of promoting science-based decision-making, an d by appropriately partic ipating to defend against 
challenges to product approvals. 
Business strategy (Medium: Pharmaceuticals, Group) 
Our business strategy is geared towa rd innovation, which is inherently  associated with risks. In our 
Pharmaceuticals Division, we see challenges in setting  up new therapy platform s, such as for cell and 
gene therapy, and in further develo ping established therapeutic areas th rough innovative solutions. On a 
Group level, we might encounter ch allenges in our endeavors to impl ement our voluntary sustainability 
commitments in a timely manner, which may also be  due to external factors. We may face negative 
financial repercussions and/or damage to our reputati on, for example, if such risks were to materialize. 
We counter these risks by aligning our organization  and our processes to existing challenges. In the 
Crop Science Division, for example, our digital far ming activities are supplemented by strategic 
partnerships with leading IT companies where n ecessary. In the Pharmaceuticals Division, meanwhile, 
we have established a cell and gene therapy unit, for example. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 109
Research and development (High: Pharmaceuticals) 
Across our businesses, we see opportunities both in the continued development of  our brands and in the 
expansion of our research pipeline as a result of  our innovation capabilitie s. In the Pharmaceuticals 
Division, opportunities arise from data science and AI and associated new R&D methods that save time 
and enhance R&D productivity. In addition, new, uniqu e screening technologies facilitate the identification 
of new lead structures to unlock previously undruggable targets, with the potential to develop new and 
innovative products. We also rely on networking, both within the company and with external partners, to 
boost our innovation capabilities. This stimulates the development of new products.  
Technological advances in pharmaceutical product de velopment may at the same time also represent a 
risk for our company should we not be in a position to play a role in shaping such advances. Securing 
access to new technologies and identifying a sufficien t number of research candidates in general while 
also ensuring their appropriate development represents  a particular challenge. Targeting in-licensing and 
acquisitions as additional ways to strengthen our co mpany involves the risk that we may be unable to 
identify a sufficient number of suit able candidates on financially accepta ble terms. We cannot ensure that 
all of the development candidates we currently have in  our pipeline, or will have in the future, will be 
developed to the stage at which they are ready to be launched on the market, or that they will obtain their 
planned approval/registration or achieve commercia l success. These goals may not be reached if, for 
example, we are unable to satisfy technical or capacity requirements or meet time constraints in product 
development, fail to achieve study objectives or do not allocate financial resources optimally. Delays or 
cost overruns may occur during product registration  or launch. We counter this risk through holistic 
portfolio management, by estimati ng the probability of success and pr ioritizing develo pment projects. 
Thanks to our innovation capacities and budgets within the Crop Science Division, we anticipate that we 
will be able to leverage opportunities and effectivel y tackle the challenges faced in developing and 
introducing product solutions in agriculture, includ ing longer and more costly  development cycles or 
stricter regulatory requirements. We plan to further leverage the strengths of our R&D platform to deliver 
pioneering technologies faster. In addi tion, we will leverage our existing ex pertise and strategically invest in 
new capabilities to unlock and capture new market segments. 
Supply of products (procurement, production, logistics)  
(High: Group; Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals)  
Despite all precautions, operations at our sites ma y be disrupted by fires, power outages, process 
changeovers – including those due to restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances – or plant 
breakdowns, for example. In addition, some of our pr oduction facilities are located in areas that may be 
affected by natural disasters such as  flooding or earthquakes. The materi alization of any of these risks 
could lead to production disruptions or stoppages, resu lt in personal injury and damage to our reputation, 
lead to declines in sales and/or ma rgins, and necessitate the reconstruc tion of damaged infrastructure. If 
we are unable to meet product demand, sales may under go a structural decline because patients may in 
the meantime be receiving alternative treatments an d may not switch back to our products. We address 
this risk for certain products by building up safety stocks and by sp reading production across multiple 
sites, for example. Furthermore, an emergency response system ba sed on a corresponding corporate 
policy has been implemented at all our production sites. 
Disruptions in our upstream suppl y chain may also negatively imp act our own supply capability. The 
substances we procure, and the companies that ma nufacture them, must meet all necessary regulatory 
requirements. These substan ces must also be suitable for fulfilling regulatory requirements further down 
the value chain. Certain materials, particularly in ou r Pharmaceuticals Division, are offered by only a small 
number of suppliers. We counter these risks by establishing relationships with alternative suppliers, concluding long-term agr eements, expanding inventories and producing raw materials ourselves. Supplier 
risks are regularly reviewed and evaluated.  
As a result of geopolitical risks and the internatio nal (supply chain) disruption they are causing, risks 
relating to the availability of necessa ry production materials and supply chain stability, for example, remain 
at the same high level as the previous year. See also the “Social and macroe conomic trends” section.

Marketing, sales and distribution (Medium: Pharmaceuticals) 
New product launches present particular challenges fo r our marketing and distribution organization, since 
assumptions about aspects such as  the market and market circumstances may not materialize as 
anticipated. As a result, product launch concepts – including those related to clinical trials – and the planning or implementation of the distribution strategy could turn ou t to be inefficient or inadequate in 
terms of scheduling. In addition, if competitors’ ma rketing activities – includin g price competition from 
generics – or advertised product ch aracteristics surpass our own efforts in  this regard, this may represent 
a risk for sales of our products. We address these risks by conducting a forward-looking analysis of 
possible scenarios and devising suitable strategies  for projects such as planned product launches. 
Human resources (Medium: Group) 
Skilled and dedicated employees are essential for our co mpany’s success. Difficulties in recruiting, hiring 
and retaining urgently needed specialized employees (o n a regional level) – also in view of competition 
between employers – and in employee development coul d have significant adverse consequences for our 
company’s future development. Developments such as  the growing relevance of disruptive technologies 
and the new operating model we inte nd to adopt, together with new ways of working, will require new, 
innovative skillsets from our employees. Based on ou r analysis of future requirements, we counter these 
risks by designing appropriate empl oyee recruitment and development meas ures. In addition, we align our 
corporate culture toward diversity an d employee needs based on data, analyses and insights, enabling us 
to tap the full potential of the employment market.  
Information technology (High: Group) 
Our business and production proce sses and our internal and external  communications are dependent on 
global IT systems. Ensuring the optimal alignment of  our IT architecture, whic h also encompasses the use 
of cloud-based services and management of any serv ice providers commissioned, therefore represents a 
challenge. This means that system reliability and the confidentiality of internal and external data are of 
fundamental importance to us. If our governance fails to adequately address this challenging environment, 
our operational stability could negatively impact our business and our informatio n security requirements 
may not be met adequately. If the risk of a breach of data confidentiality, inte grity or authenticity, for 
example due to (cyber) attacks, were to materialize, it could lead to the manipulation and/or uncontrolled 
outflow of data and knowledge, and to reputational damage. Such attacks may also be carried out by  
in-house personnel. Our business and/or production processes could also be temporarily disrupted by (cyber) attacks. To counter these risks, we evaluate and utilize new technologies . Projects and measures 
have also been implemented to keep technical security  precautions up to date an d proactively identify and 
examine new threats. In addition, security measures  implemented by the Corporate Cyber Defense Center 
protect our IT infrastructure  against unauthorized access. 
Finance and tax (Medium: Group) 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risks are defined as the possible inability of  the Bayer Group to meet current or future payment 
obligations. They are determined and managed by the Group Finance enabling function as part of our same-day and medium-term liquidity pl anning. We hold sufficient liquidity to ensure the fulfillment of all 
planned payment obligations throughout the Bayer Group at maturity. Furthermore, a reserve is maintained 
for unbudgeted shortfalls in cash receipts or unexpect ed disbursements, and its balance is regularly 
reviewed and adjusted. Credit facilities also exist wi th banks, including, in particular, an undrawn 
€4.5 billion syndicated revolving credit faci lity with a current ma turity of 2025.  
Credit risks 
Credit risks arise from the possibilit y that the value of receivables or other financial assets of the Bayer 
Group may be impaired because counterparties ca nnot meet their payment or other performance 
obligations. The maximum default risk  is reduced by existing collatera l, especially our global credit 
insurance programs. To manage credit risks from trad e receivables, the invoicing companies appoint credit 
managers who regularly analyze custom ers’ creditworthiness. We generall y agree reservation of title with 
our customers. Credit limits are set for all customers. In addition, all credit limits for debtors where total 
exposure is €10 million or more are evaluated both locally and centrally. Cred it risks from financial 
transactions are managed centrally in the Group Fina nce enabling function. To minimize risks, financial 
transactions are only conducted with in predefined exposure limits and wi th banks and other partners that 
preferably have investment-grade ratings. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 111
Opportunities and risks resulting from market price changes 
Opportunities and risks resulting fr om fluctuations in currency exch ange rates, interest rates and 
commodity prices are managed by the Group Finance enabling function. Risks are mitigated through the 
use of derivative financial instruments. The type an d level of currency, interest-rate and commodity-price 
risks are determined using sensitivity analyses as pe r IFRS 7 that are based on  hypothetical changes in 
risk variables (such as interest curves) to gauge the po tential effects of market pri ce fluctuations on equity 
and earnings. Although they fall below the external reporting threshold under our ERM system, we report 
on interest-rate and commodi ty-price risks in this section in accord ance with the provis ions of IFRS 7. 
Foreign currency opportunities and risks for our comp any arise from changes in  exchange rates and the 
related changes in the value of fina ncial instruments (including receivabl es and payables) and of anticipated 
payment receipts and disbursements no t in the functional currency. Re ceivables and payables in liquid 
currencies from operating activities and financial it ems are generally fully exch ange-hedged through cross-
currency interest-rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Anticipated exposure from planned 
payment receipts and disbursements in the future is hedged throug h forward exchange contracts and 
currency options according to management guidelines. Sensitivities were determined on the basis of a 
hypothetical scenario in which th e euro appreciates or depreciates by 10% against all other currencies 
compared with the year-end exchange rates. In th is scenario, the estimated hypothetical increase or 
decrease in cash flows from derivative and nonderivat ive financial instruments would have improved or 
diminished earnings as of December 31, 2023, by €15 million (December 31, 2022: €64 million). 
Derivatives used to hedge anticipa ted currency exposure that are de signated for hedge accounting would 
have improved or diminished equity (other comp rehensive income) by €474 million (December 31, 2022: 
€471 million). Of this amount, €158 million is related to the Brazilian real (BRL), €119 million to the Chinese 
renminbi (CNY), €42 million to the Japanese yen (J PY) and €38 million to the Canadian dollar (CAD). 
Currency effects on anticipated expo sure are not taken into account. 
Interest-rate opportunities and risks for our company ar ise from changes in capital market interest rates, 
which in turn could lead to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate fi nancial instruments and changes in 
interest payments in the case of floating-rate inst ruments. Interest-rate swaps are concluded to achieve 
the target structure for Bayer Group debt. A sensitivity analysis conducted on the basis of our net floating-
rate receivables and payables position at the end of 2023 gave the following resu lt: A hypothetical increase 
of one percentage point in these interest rates (a ssuming constant currency exchange rates) as of 
January 1, 2023, would have raised our interest expense for the year ende d December 31, 2023, by 
€4 million (December 31, 2022: €15 million). 
Commodity-price opportunities and risks arise from the volatility of raw ma terial prices, which could lead to 
an increase in the prices we pa y for seeds and energy. We reduce commodity-price risks by using 
commodity-price derivatives such as  futures, which are mainly desi gnated as hedge accounting.  
In addition, Bayer has concluded a long-term stru ctured renewable energy credit (REC) purchase 
agreement to satisfy its renewable en ergy needs in the United States. The agreement contains a contract 
for difference that is separately accounted for as a deri vative at fair value through profit or loss and is 
affected by energy pri ces. A sensitivity analysis with a hypothet ical 10% change in commodity prices for 
derivatives used for hedging purposes indicated an  effect of €58 million on eq uity (December 31, 2022: 
€38 million). A hypothetical 10% change would have resulted in a gain of €54 million or a loss of 
€68 million, respectively, through profit or loss.

3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 112
Financial risks associated with pension obligations 
The Bayer Group has obligations to current and former  employees relating to pensions and other post-
employment benefits. Changes in relevant measurement parameters such as interest rates, mortality and 
salary increase rates may raise th e present value of our pension obligations. This may lead to increased 
costs for pension plans or diminish equity due to actuarial losses being recognized in other comprehensive 
income in the statement of comprehensive income. A large proportion of our pension and other post-
employment benefit obligations is covered by plan a ssets, including fixed-income  securities, shares, real 
estate and other investments. Declining or even negative returns on these investments may adversely affect the future fair value of plan a ssets. Both of these effects may nega tively impact the development of 
equity and/or earnings, and/or may necessitate additi onal payments by our comp any. We address the risk 
of market-related fluctuations in the fair value of our plan assets th rough balanced strategic investment, 
and we constantly monitor investment risks in regard to our global pension obligations. 
Tax risks 
Bayer AG and its subsidiaries operate worldwide and are thus subject to many different national tax laws 
and regulations. The companies are re gularly audited by the tax authorities in various countries where they 
are tax residents. Amendments to ta x laws and regulations, legal judgments and their interpretation by the 
tax authorities, and the findings of tax audits in these countries may result in higher tax expense and 
payments, thus also influencing the level of tax r eceivables, tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities. Significant acquisitions, divestments, restructuring programs an d other reorganizational 
measures that we undertake could also have a negati ve impact on such items. We counter the resulting 
risks by continuously identifying an d evaluating the tax framework. We  establish provisions for taxes, 
based on estimates, for liabilities to the tax authoritie s of the respective countries that are uncertain as to 
their amount and the probability of their occurrence.  
Major programs (Medium: Group)  
We are introducing a realigned operating model that  we call Dynamic Shared Ownership, which aims to 
significantly enhance the Ba yer Group’s focus on our mission, accelerate the pace of innovation and more 
effectively harness our growth potential.  In this connection, we face the ch allenge of ensuring that we can 
adequately leverage the benefits we expect to ar ise from this transformation. Please see the Group 
Strategy section of the Strategy and Targets chapter for details. In addition, our ambitious objectives to 
standardize IT processes and systems may take lo nger to implement than planned or may not be 
completely fulfilled. Materialization of these risks co uld result in consequences  such as increased costs 
and/or disruptions in service continuity. We count er these risks by deploying dedicated teams and 
multipliers to drive forward th ese projects with the Board of Management’s full backing.  
External partner compliance (Medium: Group) 
There is a risk that our partners, such as suppliers, do not pay due attention to  our corporate values and 
requirements concerning ethics , compliance – including the observance of human rights – and 
sustainability. Besides an adverse im pact for rights-holders from a po tential human rights violation as 
defined by the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work as we ll as the financial consequences for Bayer, a 
materialization of those risks could negatively imp act our reputation and cause a supply interruption. To 
address these risks, we have clear sustainability cr iteria and standards in pl ace for our supply chain on 
both a global and regional level. With the goal of improving sustainable practices  in our supply chain, we 
operate a Group-wide four-step management proce ss that comprises the following elements: raising 
awareness, supplier selection, supplier evaluation and supplier development. We address the distinct 
human rights challenges in the seed supply chain by applying a separate human rights management 
process for seed producers.  
Health, safety and environment (Medium: Group) 
We attach great importance not on ly to product safety but also to pr otecting our employees and the 
environment, as well as to respecting human rights both within our own business operations and also in our business relationships along the value chain. Misconduct or noncompliance with legal requirements or 
Bayer Group standards may result in personal injury, damage to property, reputation or the environment, 
loss of production, business interruptions and/or liab ility for compensation paymen ts. This also includes 
risks relating to the release of hazardous substances due to an incident in production and the obligation to remediate contamination, along with risks concerning the observance of human rights and potential failure 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 113
to address them adequately. We have  put in place principles, standards and measures aimed at ensuring 
that our requirements are adequately communicated and optimally implemented. 
Intellectual property (Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals) 
Our portfolio largely consists of patent-protected pr oducts. Generic manufacturers in particular attempt to 
contest or circumvent patents prior to their expiration. We are currently  involved in legal proceedings to 
enforce patent protection for our products. Converseley, legal actio n by third parties for alleged 
infringement of patent or other property rights by Bayer may impede or even halt the development or manufacturing of certain products. We may also be re quired to pay monetary damages or royalties to third 
parties. Our patents department regu larly reviews the patent situation in  collaboration with the respective 
operating units and monitors for potential patent infringements so that legal action can be taken if necessary.  
Legal/compliance (Group) 
We are exposed to risks from legal disputes or pro ceedings to which we are currently a party or which 
could arise in the future. See Note [30] to the Conso lidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group under 
“Legal risks.” The legal proceedings outlined there are those currently considered to involve material risks 
and do not represent an exhaustive list. The general risks to which we are currently and/or potentially 
exposed include but are not limited to  those in the areas of product lia bility, securities law, breach of 
contract, competition and antitrust law, anti-corruption law, patent law, tax law, data privacy and 
environmental protection. Investigat ions of possible legal or regulato ry violations may result in the 
imposition of civil or criminal penalties – includin g substantial monetary fines – and/or other adverse 
financial consequences. Payments may also need to be  made under out-of-court settlements or adverse 
court decisions. The materialization of any of th ese risks may harm our reputation and hamper our 
commercial success. We have established a global  compliance management system to ensure the 
observance of laws and regulations.  
Glyphosate matter  
A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products 
manufactured by Bayer’s subsidiary Monsanto Compan y (“Monsanto”) have been  served upon Monsanto 
in the United States. Glyphosate is  the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto’s herbicides, 
including Roundup™-branded products. Pl aintiffs allege personal injuries  resulting from exposure to those 
products, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma, and are seeking compensatory 
and punitive damages. The plaintiffs are claiming, inte r alia, that the glyphosate-based herbicide products 
are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have kn own, of the risks allegedl y associated with such 
products and failed to adequately warn its users. A dditional lawsuits are antici pated. The majority of 
plaintiffs have brought actions in stat e courts in Missouri and California.  
As of January 31, 2024, Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial 
number of claims. Of the approximately 167,000 claims in total, approximately 113,000 have been settled or are not eligible for various reasons. As of January 31, 2024, there have been 19 Roundup ™ trials concluded before both federal and state 
courts in California, Missouri, Oregon and Pennsylvania. In 10 of those trials, the ju ries reached verdicts in 
favor of Monsanto. In the other nine trials, the pl aintiffs were awarded compensatory damages and a 
multiple thereof in punitive damages. A few of thes e cases have been settled later, but in most cases 
Monsanto has filed post-trial motions or appealed the jury verdicts, or pl ans to do so. In our opinion, these 
verdicts are based on numerous ev identiary and legal errors, as we ll as unconstitutionally excessive 
damage awards. Bayer has two appeals pending in federal court on preemption grounds: Carson, pending in the 11
th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and Schaffner , pending in the Third Circuit Federal Court of 
Appeals. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 114
As of December 31, 2023, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigati on totaled US$6.3 billion 
(€5.7 billion). Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns  in connection with the 
products mentioned above. As of January 31, 2024, a total of 32 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup™ had been served upon Bayer, including 11 seeking class action certification. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and inte nds to defend the safety of glyphosate and our 
glyphosate-based form ulations vigorously. 
PCB matters 
Bayer’s subsidiary Monsanto has been named in lawsuits brought by various governmental entities in the 
United States claiming th at Monsanto, Pharmacia and Solutia, co llectively as a manufacturer of PCBs, 
should be responsible for a variety of damages due to PCBs in the en vironment, including bodies of water, 
regardless of how PCBs came to be located there. PCBs  are chemicals that were widely used for various 
purposes until the manufacture of PCBs was prohibit ed by the EPA in the United States in 1979. 
In 2020, Bayer entered into a class se ttlement, valued at approximately US$650 million, to settle claims of 
approximately 2,500 municipal entities . In 2022, the court issued its fina l approval of the class settlement. 
There were approximately 84 opt-outs of the class settlement, 62 of which have now filed lawsuits: 
California cities, counties and municipalities (City of Los Angeles, County of San Mateo, County of Marin 
and County of Contra Costa), Illinois (City of Chicago, City of Evans ton and City of East St. Louis), 
Washington (City of Seattle) and Wisconsin (City of Milwaukee).  Currently, there are five pending st ate attorney general cases: Delaware , Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey 
and Vermont. Prior cases filed or threatened by Washington D.C., Washington, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia were settled for a combined total of approximately 
US$456 million. The Company also settl ed a pending matter with the Stat e of Oregon for US$698 million, 
reflecting unique circumstances in that State. 
The Vermont Attorney General case is different from the others in scope. In  June 2023, the Vermont 
Attorney General filed suit in stat e court alleging claims for damages related to PCB contamination of the 
state’s environment and its school buildings. The same month, a second and similar complaint (Addison 
Central School District) was filed in federal court (Dis trict of Vermont) by private lawyers representing 93 
Vermont school districts alleging PCB contamination in school buildings. In addition, there is a pending 
case in Vermont on behalf of the Burlington School District and related personal injury claims (see below).  
Monsanto also faces numerous lawsuits claiming pers onal injury due to use of and exposure to PCB 
products in school buildings. One group of cases with approximately 200 plaintiffs claims a wide variety of 
personal injuries allegedly due to PC Bs in the building products of a sc hool (Sky Valley Education Center) 
in King County, Washington. As of January 31, 2024, nine trials had been completed in these matters, involving a total of 65 plaintiffs. 20 of these plaintiffs were not successful as the ju ries decided in favor of 
Monsanto or a mistrial was declared  after the jury was unable to reach a decision. The other 45 plaintiffs 
were awarded a total of approximately US$300 million in  compensatory and a multip le thereof in punitive 
damages. The undisputed evidence in these cases does not, in Bayer’s opinion, support the conclusions 
that plaintiffs were exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs or that any exposure coul d have caused their claimed 
injuries. Each of the adverse verdicts are in differ ent stages of post-trial motions and appeal due to 
numerous significant trial errors. 
In September 2023, a putative class action lawsuit (Neddo) was filed in the District of Vermont by a mother 
on behalf of her three children who attended a local school. She alleges they are at increased risk of 
cancer from PCB exposure and seeks the cost of medi cal monitoring. The complain t identifies 26 allegedly 
contaminated schools, and the propos ed class is defined as all individu als who attended or worked at one 
of the contaminated schools. There are also five pend ing personal injury cases related to the Burlington, 
Vermont, high school. 
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 115
There are additional personal injury cases stemming from non-school PCB exposure. In August 2023, nine 
cases were filed in Massachusetts st ate court involving 16 plaintiffs who allege various personal injuries 
from alleged exposure to PCBs in or near a former Ge neral Electric landfill. A personal injury and wrongful 
death action was filed by 169 current or former employees at Clark County Government Center in Nevada. These plaintiffs allege that PCBs contaminated th e Center through prior oper ations by Union Pacific 
Railroad at the site. The Nevada action was dismissed by the court, and the plaintiffs have appealed. 
Lastly, there are four cases involvin g seven plaintiffs claiming injury  due to exposure to PCBs near 
Monsanto’s former Krummrich plant. We believe that we also have me ritorious defenses in th ese matters and intend to defend ourselves 
vigorously.  To recover costs associated with the PCB-related litigation, Bayer filed a complaint in August 2022 in the 
Circuit Court of St. Louis County for the State of Miss ouri to enforce its rights  under certain indemnity 
contracts. Under these contracts, the companies who purchased PCBs fo r use in their products agreed to 
indemnify Monsanto for PCB-related litig ation costs, including settlements. 
We may incur considerable financial disadvantages from pending lawsuits and/or potential future cases if, 
for example, we are ordered to pay compensatory and possibly punitive damages or if we assume 
payment obligations under out-of-court settlements. We could be compelled to cover any such increased 
financial requirements by issuing additional external debt, increasing our equity capital or divesting assets 
– possibly on unfavorable terms – or through combinations of these measures. The terms on which we obtain external financing could become less favorable as a result of any increased financial requirements. 
The materialization of any of th ese risks may also adversely affect our reputation and our commercial 
success. 
Product safety and stewardship (Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals) 
Despite extensive studies prior to approval or registration, products may be partially or completely withdrawn from the market due, for example, to th e occurrence of unexpected side effects or negative 
effects of our products. Such a withdrawal may be voluntar y or result from legal or regulatory measures. In 
the agriculture business in particular, there is an addi tional risk that our customers could use our products 
incorrectly. Furthermore, the presence of traces of unwanted genetically mo dified organisms in agricultural 
products and/or foodstuffs may have wide-ranging ne gative repercussions. The materialization of any of 
these risks could, for example, lead to a loss of sale s and earnings, a negative impact on our reputation 
and potential liability claims. We counter them by taking comprehensive measures in the areas of 
pharmaceutical and crop protection pr oduct safety and testing, including,  in particular, a comprehensive 
stewardship program for genetic product integrity and quality with regard to seeds. These measures are 
based on globally defined principles and include anal ysis and monitoring measures, an alert system and 
training programs.  
Quality and regulatory requirements (Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals, Group) 
In almost every country  in which we operate, our business activ ity is subject to extensive regulations, 
standards, requirements and inspectio ns that also apply to our local co ntract manufacturers. In the area of 
health, this largely pertains to clinical studies and manufacturing processes, but also to production 
materials, for example. At our Crop Science Division,  extensive requirements a pply along the value chain, 
such as in our production activities,  and also with respect to the extern al partners involved. Acquisitions 
may at times also be subject to requirements, complia nce with which must be ensured both during and 
after the integration process. Potential infringements of regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, restrictions on our freedom to operate, and/or other adverse financial consequences . They could also harm our reputation and lead to 
declining sales and/or margins. We counter these risks through binding principles, standards and the 
control mechanisms in place. Qua lity requirements are defined and implemented in global quality 
management systems.

3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 116
Security (Medium: Group) 
Potential criminal activities targeting our employees, pr operty or business activitie s represent a risk for our 
company. These include intellectual pr operty theft, vandalism, physical attacks and sabotage. In addition, 
counterfeit versions of our products could be put into circulation. There is also the risk of crisis situations such as a pandemic or a prolonged power outage th at could lead to a breakdown of our critical (IT) 
infrastructure and our prod uction. We counter these risks – which in  addition to financial effects could also 
negatively affect our reputation in some cases if th ey were to materialize – through our (local) crisis 
organizations, which produce response plans and take  further measures. We have implemented a variety 
of early warning systems. Operating globally, our s ecurity and crisis management department ensures 
continuous reporting of security in cidents and carries out regular crisis  simulation exercises worldwide.  
3.2.3 Overall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks 
by the Board of Management  
In the opinion of the Board of Management, based on the current evaluations, none of the risks described 
above endanger the company’s continued existence. No r could we identify any potential threat to our 
continued existence, including wh en comparing our risk-bearing capaci ty with our aggregated risk 
situation. We currently have not id entified any material change in ou r risk status compared with the 
assessment given in the 2022 Annual Report. We remain convinced that we can take advantage of the opportunities arising from our entrep reneurial activity and successfully mast er the challenges resulting from 
the risks stated above.

Information on corpo rate governance practices 
Bayer AG is subject to German stock corporatio n law and therefore has a dual governance system 
consisting of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, which manage the company based on a transparent strategy that is geared toward its lo ng-term success and complies with applicable law and 
ethical standards.  
Corporate governance practices that  go beyond the legal requiremen ts are derived from our mission, 
guiding principles and target behaviors, which form the basis of the respectful working relationship between our employees and with our external partners, and cover all stages of the value chain. The main 
guidelines are summarized primarily in our corporate policies on comp liance, human rights, and fairness 
and respect at work, as well as in our Supplier Co de of Conduct and the Bayer Societal Engagement 
(BASE) principles. The organization and oversight obligations of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are mainly en sured by compliance management and risk management systems. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
4.1 Declaration by Corporate Management Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code 118
Board of Management 
Composition, objectives (diversity concept) and succession planning 
The Board of Management effectively consisted of six members in 2023. In April and May, it included a 
seventh member on a transitional basis. The Bo ard of Management runs the company on its own 
responsibility with the goal of ach ieving defined corporate objectiv es and sustainably increasing the 
company’s enterprise value. 
With regard to the composition of the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board takes into account 
specialist expertise and personal aptitude, as well as aspects such  as age, gender, education and 
professional background. Pursuant to Section 76, Paragraph 3a of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Supervisory Board must ensure that the Board of Manageme nt includes at least one woman 
and at least one man if it consists  of three or more members.   
An additional aspect relating to the composition of the Board of Management that the Supervisory Board 
has resolved to pursue is diversity. Without basing se lection decisions on this aspect in individual cases, 
the Supervisory Board aims to ensure that different age groups ar e adequately represented on the Board 
of Management, while also taking into account the ex perience required for a position on the Board of 
Management. Irrespective of this, members of the Board of Management should generally step down from 
that office when they turn 62. The composition of the Board of Management should adequately reflect the 
company’s international oper ations. The Supervisory Board therefore endeavors to include on the Board of 
Management several members of different nationalities or with an international background (e.g., several 
years of career experience outside Germany or th e oversight of foreign business activities). The 
Supervisory Board also strives to ensure diversity with regard to the educational and professional 
backgrounds of the members of the Board of Manage ment. In addition to the specific professional 
expertise and the management and leadership experi ence required for the given task, members of the 
Board of Management should cover the broadest possible spectrum of knowledge, experience, and 
educational and professional backgrounds.  
These objectives are taken into account when selecting candidates to fill open positions on the Board of 
Management. In doing so, the Supervisory Board aims to  ensure not just the grea test possible individual 
suitability of its various members, but also that as many different perspectives as possible are represented 
in the leadership of the company through a balanced  and diverse Board of Management structure, and 
that the candidate selection pool is as large as possible. 
In accordance with the statut ory requirements of the Second Leader ship Positions Act (FüPoG II), there 
are also targets pertaining to the proportion of wo men at the first and second management levels below 
the Board of Management. The Board of Management has set targets of 35%
22, 23 women at the first 
management level of Bayer AG and 35%23, 24 women at the second manageme nt level. These targets are 
to be attained by June 30, 2027.  
As part of the succession planning process, the Board of Management informs the Supervisory Board 
about candidates who have been identified as having  the potential to become a member of the Board of 
Management. Among other things, th e Supervisory Board places emphasis  on intensive human resources 
development at the management level below the Bo ard of Management while taking into account the 
diversity criteria outlined above.  The Supervisory Board endeavors to  meet the respective candidates 
personally during presentations given to the Supervisory Board or its committees, or on other occasions. The company has identified candida tes who would be able to step in to replace individual Board of 
Management members and assume thei r roles at short notice if required . Whenever it becomes clear that 
there will be an empty seat on the Board of Manage ment, efforts are undertaken to identify and evaluate 
prospective candidates inside and outside the company. When necessa ry, an HR consulting firm is 
brought in to aid the process.  
 
22 Formal target pursuant to FüPoG II: 36 16/19% 
23 Based on the target size, the formal target pursuant to FüPoG II indicates the percentage to be specified that results in a wh ole headcount 
based on the current size of the group. 
24 Formal target pursuant to FüPoG II: 35 35/199%

4.1 Declaration by Corporate Management Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code 119
Bill Anderson was appointed to the Board of Manage ment effective April 1, 2023, and became Chairman 
(CEO) effective June 1, 2023. Werner Baumann and th e Supervisory Board had pr eviously agreed that 
Baumann’s contract as member and Chairman of Baye r’s Board of Management (CEO), which was set to 
run until April 30, 2024, should be te rminated prematurely. Baumann’s se rvice contract and term of office 
came to an end by mutual co nsent on May 31, 2023.  
Heike Prinz was appointed to the Board of Manage ment effective September 1, 2023, and became the 
company’s Labor Director. She also serves as Chi ef Talent Officer. Prinz succeeded Sarena Lin, who 
vacated her seat on the Board of Management on August 31, 2023. 
Implementation status of the objectives 
In line with the objectives, differen t age groups are represented on th e Board of Management, while also 
taking into account the experience re quired for Board of Management po sitions. The ages of the members 
of the Board of Management ranged from 50 to 59  years as of December 31,  2023. Three of the six 
members of the Board of Management serving as of December 31, 2023, are citi zens of a country other 
than Germany. All members of the Board of Manage ment have amassed many years of career experience 
outside Germany. The members of the Board of Manage ment also have diverse professional backgrounds. 
The legal requirement that the Board of Management must include at least one woman and at least one 
man has been met. 
Procedures and committees 
The Board of Management performs its tasks according to the law, the Ar ticles of Incorporation and the 
Board of Management’s rules of procedure, which gov ern the provision of information to the Supervisory 
Board, for example. It also works with the company’s other governance bodies in a spirit of trust. There 
are no Board of Management committees. 
Supervisory Board 
Composition and objectives (diversity concept and expertise profile) Under the German Codetermination Act, half of th e Supervisory Board’s 20 members are elected by the 
stockholders and the other half  by the company’s employees.  
The Supervisory Board endeavors to ensure that its members collectivel y possess the necessary expertise, 
skills and professional experience to properly perform their duties. This  includes the following areas: 
management and leadership of international compan ies, a business understanding with regard to the 
company’s main areas of activity, research and de velopment, finance, controlling/risk management, 
human resources, governance/compliance, digitalizatio n (including IT, AI and cyber security) and key 
sustainability aspects for the company, such  as climate protection and biodiversity.  
The Supervisory Board has also resolved to pursue dive rsity in its composition, for instance with regard to 
age, gender, education and profession al background. This is aimed at en suring that the oversight of the 
company incorporates the broadest possible range of perspectives, and at keeping the candidate pool as 
large as possible. With respect to the international business alignment of Bayer AG, the Supervisory Board 
strives to ensure at all times that several of its members have international business experience or an 
international background in other respects. Further  objectives concerning the composition of the 
Supervisory Board are that different age groups be suitably represented on the Supervisory Board and 
that, absent special circumstances, a member should not hold office beyond the end of the next Annual Stockholders’ Meeting following their 72
nd birthday. With a view to avoiding potential conflicts of interest 
and taking into account the ownership structure of the company and the number of independent 
Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board has set itself the goal that more than half of the 
stockholder representatives be independent. The Supervisory Board assesses the independence of its 
members according to the recomme ndation contained in Section C.7 of the German Corporate 
Governance Code. The Superv isory Board endeavors to ensure that the terms of service of its members 
are evenly spread, with members serving for no longer than 12 years. This restriction on the term of service will take effect from fiscal 2024 and will apply for serving members once th eir current elected term 
comes to an end. 
The Nomination Committee and the full Supervisory Board take these obj ectives into cons ideration when 
nominating candidates to fill open positions on the Supervis ory Board. The stated objectives refer to the 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
4.1 Declaration by Corporate Management Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code 120
Supervisory Board as a whole, unless otherwise dete rmined. However, since th e Supervisory Board can 
only nominate candidates for election as stockholder representatives, it can only take the objectives into 
account in these nominations. One objective for Supe rvisory Board elections is  that neither women nor 
men account for less than 30% of the membersh ip, in line with the legal requirements. 
Implementation status of the objectives 
The Supervisory Board has several members with inte rnational business experience or an international 
background. The ages of the members of the Superv isory Board ranged from 51 to 69 years as of 
December 31, 2023. One member of th e Supervisory Board, Dr. Paul Achleitner, has been a member of 
the Supervisory Board for more than  12 years. As such, the Supervis ory Board does not consider him to 
be independent as defined in Section C.7 of th e German Corporate Govern ance Code. However, the 
Supervisory Board does not harbor any concerns abou t Dr. Achleitner’s impartiality or any potential 
conflicts of interest.  
The Supervisory Board considers the stockholder representatives Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah, Horst Baier, 
Dr. Norbert Bischofberger, Ertharin Cousin, Colleen A. Goggins, Kimberly Mathisen, Alberto Weisser, Prof. Dr. Otmar Wiestler and Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann to be independent. The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is currently 45% for the full Supervisory Boar d; 50% for the employee 
representatives and 40% for the stockholder representa tives. Seven of the 20 members of the Supervisory 
Board are citizens of a country other than German y. Numerous other members have many years of 
international business experience. The members of th e Supervisory Board have also completed a whole 
range of vocational training and study courses. 
For the purposes of the qualificat ion matrices below, the Supervis ory Board primarily considers its 
members to possess expertise and experience in the corresponding areas if they have completed 
professional training in that field or have amassed ma ny years of professional experience (including several 
years as a member of the Supervisory Board or one of its respective committees).  
In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the stoc kholder representatives ha ve the following special 
expertise and experience, as well as  the following independence status:

Procedure and committees 
The role of the Supervisory Board is to oversee and advise the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board is directly involved in d ecisions on matters of fundamental importance to the company, regularly 
conferring with the Board of Management on the co mpany’s strategic alignmen t and the implementation 
status of the business strategy. The Report of the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report provides details 
about the work of the Supervisory Board and its co mmittees. In addition to th e Presidial Committee and 
the Nomination Committee, the Su pervisory Board also has an I nnovation Committee and an ESG 
Committee to oversee and advise the Board of Management on matters relating to innovation and sustainability, respectively. Furthermore, the Hu man Resources and Compensation Committee deals 
intensively with succession planning and the compensation of the Board of Management. The Audit 
Committee discusses the audit risk assessment, the audi t strategy and audit planni ng, as well as the audit 
results with the auditor. As part of this process, the Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly discusses 
the progress of the audit with the independent auditor, including during conversations held outside the meetings of the Audit Committee, and reports to the Committee. The Audit Committee consults with the independent auditor on a regular basis, both wi th and without the Board of Management present.
  
The Supervisory Board has set itself rules of proced ure that are published on the company’s website. 
These rules govern various aspects, such as how conf licts of interest are handled. In line with the 
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the rules of proced ure state that conflicts 
of interest must be disclosed to the Chairman of th e Supervisory Board, and that material conflicts of 
interest that are not merely temporary in nature shall result in the termination of that person’s appointment to the Supervisory Board. 
When new members join the Supervisory Board, a series  of introductory meetings are arranged with the 
members of the Board of Management and with repr esentatives from specialist functions to introduce 
them to their work on the Supervisory Board, and inform ational material is also provided in written form.  
Training events are held for the me mbers of the Supervisory Board at regular intervals. In 2023, they 
focused largely on digitalization issues. In 2023, the Supervisory Board conducted a self-assessment to 
evaluate how effectively it performs it s duties. An external consultant wa s brought in to aid the process. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
4.2 Compliance 122
Further information 
Securities transactions by members of governance bodies  
Members of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board and persons with whom they have close relationships are legally obligated to report own-account tr ansactions in shares or debt securities of Bayer 
AG, associated derivatives or other associated financ ial instruments to Bayer AG and the German Federal 
Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) as soon as the total volume of transactio ns made by a member of 
the Board of Management or Supervisory Board, or a person with whom they have a close relationship, 
has reached the €20,000 thre shold within a calendar year. The transa ctions reported to Bayer AG in 2023 
were duly published and can be vi ewed on the company’s website. 
4.2 Compliance 
We define compliance as legally impeccable conduct by  all employees in their daily work, because the way 
they carry out their duties affects our company’s reputation. We do n ot tolerate any violation of applicable 
laws, codes of conduct or internal regulations. Compliance is essential fo r our long-term economic 
success. 
The following compliance principles apply throughout the Bayer Group: 
// We compete fairly in every market. 
// We act with integrity in all our business dealings. 
// We balance economic growth with eco logical and social  responsibility. 
// We observe trade controls that regulate our global business. 
// We safeguard equal opportunity in securities trading. 
// We keep accurate books and records. 
// We treat each other with fairness and respect. 
// We protect and respect intellectual property rights. 
// We act in Bayer’s best interest. 
// We protect and secure personal data. 
All employees are required to observe the compliance pr inciples and to immediately report any violation of 
the Corporate Compliance Policy. Infringements are sanc tioned. This applies in particular to managerial 
employees, who, for example, may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be 
subject to further disciplinary measures  if violations that they could ha ve prevented have occurred in their 
sphere of responsibility. Compliant and lawful conduc t also factors into the performance evaluations of all 
managerial employees. 
The global compliance management system is steered  by a central compliance organization within the 
Bayer Group that reports to the Chief Financia l Officer (CFO) and to th e Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board. The CFO is resp onsible for the compliance organiza tion, while the Audit Committee of 
the Supervisory Board ov ersees the effectiveness and further de velopment of compliance within the 
Group. 
Potential compliance risks (such as co rruption) are identified together with the operational units to ensure 
the systematic and preventive detection and assessment  of risks. Potential risks are then entered into 
global databases that we use to develop suitable m easures for specific processe s, business activities or 
countries, for example. In addition, we assess our business partners according to risk criteria as we look 
to identify potential compliance risks. Adherence to the corporate compliance pr inciples is among the 
subjects covered in audits conducted by Bayer’s Internal Audi t and in the analyses and investigations by 
the legal and compliance organization. The heads of these organizations provide regular reports on the findings of the audits and analyses to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, while summary reports are presented at least once a year. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
4.2 Compliance 123
Handling of suspected and actual compliance violations 
Suspected compliance violations can be reported – anonymously if desi red and if permitted by respective 
national law – to a globally accessible compliance hot line that is operated by an independent service 
provider. Reports can be submitted either online or  by telephone, with calls answered by trained, 
independent specialists. Those submitti ng reports can do so in their pref erred language. The hotline is also 
accessible to the general public.  
In 2023, the Compliance organiza tion received a total of 595 co mpliance reports in this way. 
In addition, there is a so-called “speak-up inbox” at Bayer for the submission of suspected compliance 
violations. Alternatively, suspected  violations may also be reported to the local Compliance function, 
Internal Audit, Human Resources or directly to the supervisor. Suspected complia nce violations may also 
be reported by logging an incident request on a platform. Moreover, the Compliance function records and 
processes compliance violations discovered as part of monitoring activities. In 2023, there was a total of 
1,494 suspected compliance violations. 
Compliance violations include all possible types of infr ingements of internal and external requirements and 
are systematically sanctioned. The action taken depend s on factors including the gravity of the compliance 
violation and applicable law.  
Compliance training and communications activities 
We support all employees in acting with integrity and pro actively avoiding potential violations by 
implementing Bayer-wide training measures that are tailored to target groups and based on identified 
needs, flanked by communication campaigns. Supervis ors and/or compliance mana gers can be consulted 
if there are any questions about lawful behavior. 
Training measures on anti-corruptio n, the importance of openly expressi ng concerns (“speak up”), antitrust 
law, conflicts of interest, fairness and respect in the workplace, foreign trad e law compliance, product-
related communication and data protection are fund amental elements of our compliance management 
system. 
In 2023, some 95.7% of Bayer’s managerial empl oyees worldwide completed at least one compliance 
training program. Overall, around 83.1% of employees took part in the global web-based training program on anti-corruption.  
Marketing compliance and applicability of accepted standards 
We are committed to responsible marketing practices. Our efforts in this regard are guided by our 
Corporate Compliance Policy, Anti-Co rruption Policy and rules of conduc t for responsible marketing, for 
example. 
We have also put in place directives and corporate po licies that are designed to prevent price fixing and 
ensure data protection. Various industry codes such as those of the International Federation of 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associ ations (IFPMA) and the European  Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Industries and Associations (EFPIA) also apply in marketing and distribution. As regards the advertising of 
human pharmaceutical products, we comply with the IFPMA Code of Practice as the minimum global 
standard, along with the re gulations set out in the applicable regi onal and national codes. Pharmaceuticals 
observes the applicable transparency rules (e.g., th e Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the United 
States) and participates in voluntary prog rams such as the EFPIA Disclosure Code. 
Crop Science’s Product Stewardship Commitment app lies to all products, services and technologies and 
is in alignment with the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the Code of Conduct on Plant Biotechnology issued by CropLife International, for example.

4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 315b and c of the German Commercial Code 124
Lobbying 
Forming part of our commitment to ensuring transparent lobbying, our “Code of Conduct for Responsible Lobbying” sets out binding rules for our involvement in  political matters and creat es transparency in our 
interactions with the representatives of political institutions.  
As set out in this code of conduct, our company did n ot make any donations to political parties, politicians 
or candidates for political office in 2023. Effective January 1, 2022, we abolished our applicable exemption 
for the United States, meaning that we no longer donate directly as  a company. However, one special 
aspect continues to apply: employees can make private donations in support of political nominees at the 
federal level through so-called “po litical action committees.” These vol untary donations are made only by 
employees, not the company. Deci sions on how the donations made through Bayer’s political action 
committee, BAYERPAC, are a llocated are made by an independent committee made up of employees. The 
allocation criteria it applies reflect  societal challenges, among other fact ors. These donations are subject to 
narrow conditions and mandatory tran sparency measures. We also apply the Bayer Societal Engagement 
(BASE) principles, which are afforded the status of a global corporate policy and serve to codify our 
standards and values to an even greater degree. 
4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 
315b and c of the German Commercial Code

4.4 Takeover-Relevant Information 
Explanatory report pursuant to Section 289a, Paragraph 1 and Section 
315a, Paragraph 1 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) 
The capital stock of Bayer AG am ounted to €2,515,005,649.92 as of December 31, 2023, divided into 
982,424,082 no-par registered shares. The capital st ock and the number of shares were thus unchanged 
from the end of the previous year. Each share confer s one voting right. A small number of shares may be 
subject to temporary trading restrictions, such as retention periods, in conn ection with employee stock 
participation programs. We received no  notifications in 2023 of direct or  indirect holdings of shares in 
Bayer AG that exceed 10% of the capital stock. The co mpany thus is not in posse ssion of any notifications 
of holdings that exceed 10% of the capital stock. 
The appointment and dismissal of members of the Boar d of Management are subject to the provisions of 
Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act, Section 31 of the German Codetermination 
Act and Section 6 of the company’s Ar ticles of Incorporation. Pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 1 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Board of Management are appointed and dismissed 
by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board ma y appoint one member of the Board of Management 
to be the Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 2 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act and Section 6, Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Incorporation. Pursuant to 
Section 84, Paragraph 3 of the German Stock Corp oration Act, the Supervisory Board must grant a 
Board of Management member’s request to revoke their appointment to the Board of Management in 
certain cases, and must also guarantee that memb er’s reappointment after certain periods. Since 
Bayer AG falls within the scope of the German Code termination Act, Section 31 of that act governs the 
voting majority required for the appointment or di smissal of members of the Board of Management as 
well as the voting procedure within the Supervisory Bo ard. Under Section 6, Paragraph 1 of the Articles 
of Incorporation of Bayer AG, the number of members of the Board of Management is determined by the 
Supervisory Board but must be at least two. As a pu blicly listed company that is subject to the German 
Codetermination Act, Bayer AG must ensure under  Section 76, Paragraph 3a of the German Stock 
Corporation Act that its Board of Management incl udes at least one man and one woman if the number 
of members is greater than three. 
Any amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are made pursuant to  Section 179 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act and Sections 10 and 17 of the Articles of Incorporation. Under Section 179, Paragraph 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of Incorporation require a resolution of the Stockholders’ Meeting. Pursuant to Section 179, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, this resolution must be passed by a majority of three-quarters of the voting capital represented at the meeting, unless the Articles of Incorporation pr ovide for a different majori ty. However, where an 
amendment relates to a change in the object of th e company, the Articles of Incorporation may only 
specify a larger majority. Section 17 , Paragraph 2 of the Articles of In corporation of Bayer AG utilizes the 
scope for deviation pursuant to Section 179, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act and provides that resolutions may be passed by a simple ma jority of the votes cast or , where a capital majority 
is required, by a simple majority of the capital represented. Pursuant to Section 10, Paragraph 9 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board may resolve on amendments to the Articles of 
Incorporation that relate solely to their wording. 
The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting held on April 26, 2019, resolved that the Board of Management be 
authorized to purchase and dispose of  own shares representing up to 10% of the capital stock existing at 
the time the resolution was adopted. This authorization expires on April 25, 2024. The authorization to purchase own shares also includes the purchase of own shares using put or call options (derivatives) up to 
a volume of 5% of the capital stock existing at the time the resolution was adopted or at the time the 
authorization is exercised. Stockholders’ subscription rights may be excluded, depending on the purpose for which the purchased own shares are to be used.

4.4 Takeover-Relevant Information 126
A material agreement that is subject  to the condition precedent of a change of control pertains to the 
undrawn €4.5 billion syndicated cred it facility arranged by Bayer AG  and its US subsidiary Bayer 
Corporation. This facility is availabl e until December 2025. The participatin g banks are entitled to terminate 
the credit facility in the event of a change of contro l at Bayer and demand repayment of any loans that may 
have been granted under this facility up to that time . A similar clause is contained in the terms of a 
syndicated credit facility amounting to €3 billion that wa s fully drawn by Bayer AG  in May 2022 and fully 
repaid in December 2023. 
In 2018, Bayer Capital Corporation B. V. issued a bond  with a nominal volume of €5 billion and Bayer US 
Finance II LLC issued, in 144A/RegS format, a US$15 billion bond and another US$5.7 billion bond. All 
three bonds are guaranteed by Bayer AG. Holders of these bonds have the right to demand the 
redemption of bonds by Bayer AG in the event of a change of control if Bayer AG’s credit rating were to 
deteriorate within 120 days after su ch change of control becomes effec tive, although the period for a 
potential deterioration of Bayer AG’s credit rating is only 60 days in the case of  the US$15 billion bond and 
the US$5.7 billion bond. As of December 31, 2023, the original US$15 billion bond had an outstanding 
amount of US$9 billion, the original  US$5.7 billion bond had an outsta nding amount of US$4.7 billion and 
the original €5 billion bond had an outstanding amount of €3.3 billion. 
The terms of the €3 billion note issued by Bayer under  its Debt Issuance Program in 2023, the full amount 
of which was outstanding as of December 31, 2023, also contain a corresponding ch ange-of-control 
clause associated with a deterioration of the credit rating within 120 days. Clau ses to this effect were also 
included in the terms of the US$7 billion bond in 144A/Reg S format issued  in 2014 by Bayer US 
Finance LLC and guaranteed by Bayer AG, which had an outstanding amount of  US$1.8 billion as of 
December 31, 2023; the nominal €6 billion bond issued by  Bayer AG in 2020, the full amount of which was 
outstanding as of December 31, 2023; the nominal €4 billion bond i ssued by Bayer AG in 2021, the full 
amount of which was outstanding as of December 31 , 2023, and the US$5.75 billion bond in 144A/Reg S 
format issued in November 2023 by Bayer US Fina nce LLC and guaranteed by Bayer AG, the full amount 
of which was outstanding as of D ecember 31, 2023. In the case of the US$5.75 billion bond, the period for 
a potential deterioration of Bayer AG’s credit rating is only 60 days. 
In the event of a change of contro l, members of the Board of Management are entitled to a severance 
payment of 250% of annual base compensation if certain narrow conditions are met. The payment is limited to the compensation for the remaining term of the contract, capped at twice the annual compensation.

5. Information on Bayer AG 
Business lease agreements exist between Bayer AG on the one hand, and Bayer CropScience AG and 
Bayer Pharma AG – the former parent companies of the divisions Crop Scien ce and Pharmaceuticals – on 
the other. Bayer AG as lessee manages these two companies’ operational businesses on the basis of these agreements. In addition to its holding company function, Bayer AG thus also performs the parent company functions with respect to the two divisions. 
Bayer AG is a generator and supplier of utilities at mult iple locations and thus an energy utility as defined in 
Section 3, No. 18 of the German En ergy Industry Act (EnWG). Since ut ility supply networks are operated 
by a subsidiary, Bayer AG also constitutes a vertically  integrated energy utility und er Section 3, No. 38 of 
the EnWG. However, regarding its own activities, it is only subject to the separate accounting obligation and not the obligation to pr epare activity reports. 
The financial statements of Bayer AG are prepar ed in accordance with the German Commercial Code 
(HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Be cause the company is an in tegrated energy utility, 
the provisions of Section 6b of  the EnWG are also observed.

Development of earnings 
Bayer AG met its sales forecast of approximately €16 billion in 2023. As expected, sales declined in the 
Pharmaceuticals Division, where the perf ormance of the main product Xarelto™ was weaker than 
projected. This was offset by some products exceeding expectations, especially our new product 
Kerendia™ as well as Adempas™. Sales from the internal  charging-on of costs for services remained level 
and internal sales at Crop Scien ce slightly exceeded expe ctations. Operating earni ngs were boosted by 
positive currency effects, insuran ce payouts, a €755 million decline in expenses for company pension 
plans due to modified pension trend assumptions, and a €340 million dec line in provisions for wages and 
salaries that mainly related to va riable compensation comp onents, the reduction in which had a positive 
impact on the cost structure. There was an operatin g loss of roughly €1.3 billion, which was €1.2 billion 
narrower than planned. 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
5.1 Earnings Performance of Bayer AG 128
Sales of Bayer AG declined by about 3% to  €15,961 million in 2023 (2 022: €16,470 million). 
Sales at the Crop Science Divisio n came in at €4,994 million, exceedin g the prior-year level (2022: 
€4,817 million). This positive busine ss performance was attributable to higher prices fo r crop protection 
products. Intra-Group sales rose to €4,584 million (2 022: €4,434 million). Extern al sales also improved, 
coming in at €410 million (2022: €383 million), mainly due to th e expansion of business at SeedGrowth. 
The Fungicides and Insecticides business units saw sale s rise to €2,111 million (2022: €1,897 million) and 
€857 million (2022: €843 million), respectively, in 202 3, while sales at Herbicides fell to €1,263 million 
(2022: €1,341 million). On a regional level, sales c limbed to €2,300 million (20 22: €2,021 million) in 
Europe/Middle East/Africa and €1,168 million (2022: €1,114 million) in North America, mainly due to the 
increase in sales at the SeedGrowth and Fungicides business units. Sales in the Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions declined to €986 million (2022: €1 ,117 million) and €540 m illion (2022: €565 million), 
respectively, largely due to lower sales at Fungicides and SeedGrowth. 
The Pharmaceuticals Division posted  a decline in sales to €9,732 m illion (2022: €10,383  million). Intra-
Group sales fell to €8,881 million (2022: €9,475 millio n) and external sales to €851 million (2022: 
€908 million). The decline in Xarelto™ sales to €3,289  million (2022: €3,753 millio n) was primarily due to 
lower demand in Russia. The decline in Adempas™  sales to €572 million (2022: €648 million) was 
attributable to lower demand due to an inventory-related e ffect in 2022 in the United States, and the 
decline in Adalat™ sales to €401 m illion (2022: €674 million) was mainly attributable to te nder procedures 
in China. The increase in Kerendia™ sales to €335 million (2022: €102 million) was primarily due to the 
product’s launch in the United States in 2021 and the resulting increase in demand. On a regional level, 
sales at the Pharmaceuticals Division declined to €4, 655 million (2022: €4,937 m illion) in Europe/Middle 
East/Africa, largely due to lower de mand for Xarelto™ in Russia. The de cline in sales in North America to 
€2,233 million (2022: €2,301 million) was mainly attrib utable to lower demand for Adempas™, although 
this was largely offset by increased demand fo r Kerendia™. Sales in Asia/Pacific decreased to 
€2,330 million (2022: €2,711 million), mainly as a result  of weaker demand for Adalat™ in China. The 
increase in sales in Latin America to €514 million (20 22: €434 million) was primarily driven by higher 
demand for Xarelto™.  
Sales at Enabling Functions fell to €1 ,235 million (2022: €1,270 million).  
Other operating income dropped to €3,731 million (2022: €4,294 million), due especially to the decline in 
exchange gains to €2,930 million (20 22: €3,852 million). This effect was pa rtly offset by higher income 
from the reversal of provisions (€ 500 million; 2022: €139 million), whic h in turn mainly pertained to the 
reversal of provisions for restructuring (€263 millio n; 2022: €84 million) and for pensions and other post-
employment benefits (€113 million;  2022: €0 million). In addition, an  insurance claim resulted in 
compensation of €200 million.  
The cost of materials decreased by around 3% ye ar on year to €11,204 million (2022: €11,597 million). 
Personnel expenses declined to €2, 340 million (2022: €3,431 million), primarily due to  lower expenses for 
company pension plans as a result of modified pensio n trend assumptions, as well as reduced provisions 
for variable compensation components.  
Other operating expenses fell to €7,580 million (2022:  €8,637 million). The year-on-year change resulted 
from a decrease in expenses from foreign currency translation to €2,841 millio n (2022: €4,268 million), a 
decline in costs assumed for restru cturing measures to €1 94 million (2022: €344 million), and a fall in 
marketing and selling expenses to €463 million (2022: € 577 million). These effects were  partly offset by an 
increase in rental and leasing expe nses to €445 million (2022: €357 m illion) and a rise in expenses for 
impairment losses on receivables  to €78 million (2022: €7 million). 
Research and development expenses, consisting of related personnel and nonpersonnel costs within the 
respective expense item, amounted  to €2,532 million (2022: €2,520 m illion). Of the total expenses, 
€677 million (2022: €747 million) was attributable to the Crop Science Division and €1,855  million (2022: 
€1,773 million) to the Pharmaceuticals Div ision. The decline at Crop Scie nce was due to a decrease in the 
intra-Group charging-on of costs, while the increase at Pharmaceuti cals was mainly attributable to projects 
in advanced clinical development. As of December 31, 2023, there were 4,577 employees (FTEs) working 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report 129
in research and development. Research and develo pment expenses correspond ed to a 16% (2022: 15%) 
share of sales. 
The company recorded an operating loss of €1, 327 million for 2023 ( 2022: €3,074 million). 
The balance of income and expenses from investme nts in affiliated companies was €7,126 million (2022: 
€9,257 million), and thus down year  on year. Dividends and similar income from subsidiaries rose 
significantly to €1,104 million (2022: €291 million). Th is development was mainly attributable to the 
dividend payment of €1,000 million by Bayer Hispania , S.L.U., Spain (2022: €0 million). The balance of 
income and expenses from profit and loss trans fer agreements with subsidiaries improved to 
€2,092 million (2022: minus €601 million). This was driven  by the profit transferred by Bayer Pharma AG 
(€1,759 million; 2022: €120 million) – due mainly to higher profit and loss tr ansfers and the sale of 
investments in affiliated companies – and the profit transferred by Neunte Bayer VV GmbH (€604 million; 
2022: minus €785 million). The balance of other in come and expenses from investments in affiliated 
companies, which includes gains from the sale of in vestments in affiliated compan ies together with write-
downs and write-ups thereof, declined to €3,930 m illion (2022: €9,567 million) due to lower gains of 
€3,939 million (2022: €9,592 million) resulting from intr a-Group changes in the sh areholding structure.  
Net interest expense in 2023 dec lined to €622 million (2022: €1,199 milli on), largely due to effects from the 
unwinding of the discount on pension and noncurrent personnel-related commitments and the development of plan assets. The balance of income /expense from the unwinding of discount and the 
development of plan assets improved to €439 million (2022: minus €1,210 million). This mainly reflected 
the balance of income from plan assets of Bayer Pens ion Trust e. V. (BPT) (€53 1 million; 2022: expense of 
€970 million), which was due to the favo rable development of the fair value of the assets held by BPT, and 
interest expense from the unwinding of discount on  pension provisions (€92 million, 2022: €240 million). 
The balance of other financial expenses and other fi nancial income was positive, at €22 million (2022: 
minus €27 million). The improvement resulted mainly from higher income – recognized in the financial result 
– from the retirement of bonds (€31 million; 2022: €0 million), and a lower negative net impact from 
expenses for pension and other noncu rrent personnel-related provisions not being charged on (€15 million, 
2022: €44 million). 
In 2023, the company generated in come of €5,199 million before in come taxes (2022: €4,957 million). 
After deduction of €49 million (2022:  €193 million) in taxes, net income  amounted to €5 ,150 million (2022: 
€4,764 million). After allocating €2,575 million of th is net income to other retained earnings, the 
distributable profit amounted to €2,575 million. The Board of Mana gement will propose to the Annual 
Stockholders’ Meeting on April 26, 2024, that, of the di stributable profit of €2,574,582,046.65 reported in 
the annual financial statements for the fiscal year 2023, an amount of €108,066,649.02 be used to pay a 
dividend of €0.11 per share carrying dividend rights and the remaining amount of €2,466,515,397.63 be 
allocated to other retained earnings.

Development of items in the statement of financial position 
As in previous years, Bayer AG’s fi nancial position reflected the management function it performs for the 
Group, particularly with respect to the company’s shareholdings and Group financing. The statement of 
financial position is characterized by these shareholdings and the receiva bles and payables vis-à-vis Group 
companies. Total assets decreased to €97, 200 million in 2023 (202 2: €101,106 million). 
Noncurrent assets climbed to €85,457 million overa ll (2022: €82,799 million). Intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment came in at €388 million and were thus nearly unc hanged year on year 
(2022: €361 million). Financial assets  increased to €85,069 million (2022:  €82,438 million). The change in 
the shareholding structure, as part of an intra-Group contribution in kind through a share swap, generated a book profit of €3,939 million and a corresponding in crease in financial assets, with additions through 
new Bayer Pharma AG shares (€4,825 million) partly offset by the reti rement of a shareholding in Bayer 
Gesellschaft für Beteiligungen mbH (€ 886 million). Loans to subsidiaries  declined by €1 ,525 million to 
€12,441 million, mainly due to a €1,424 million repayment by Baye r CropScience AG. The €125 million 
decrease in other loans to €1,354 millio n resulted from Bayer-Pensionskasse  VVaG repaying portions of its 
effective initial fund (€126 million). 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 A Combined Management Report
5.2 Asset and Financial Position of Bayer AG 131
Current and miscellaneous assets fell to €11,743 m illion (2022: €18,307 million) . Inventories increased to 
€3,061 million (2022: €2,824 million). Accounts receivable from subsidiaries, which mainly comprised loan 
receivables and receivables under profit and loss transfer agreements, fe ll to €1,525 million (2022: 
€5,388 million). The increase in other  assets to €680 million (2022: €426 million) largely resulted from 
higher tax receivables. Holdings of marketable secu rities declined to €1,328 million (2022: €3,652 million) 
due to the sale of euro and US dollar investments with indefinite maturities. 
Equity rose by €2,792 million to €36, 042 million (2022: €33,250 million).  
Provisions fell to €5,460 million (2022: €6,947 million). Th e provisions recognized for the excess of pension 
liabilities over plan assets declined to €3,232 millio n (2022: €3,676 million). This change was partly 
attributable to an increase in fund assets due to the favorable development of th e fair value of the assets 
held by BPT, and lower obligations from pension entitlements due to mo dified pension trend assumptions. 
Provisions for taxes fell to €488 millio n (2022: €630 millio n), primarily due to the change in provisions for 
income taxes not yet finally a ssessed. Miscellaneous provisions  fell to €1,740 million (2022: 
€2,641 million), with perso nnel-related provisions decreasing to €1, 032 million (2022: €1, 513 million). This 
was mainly attributable to a declin e in provisions for variable compen sation components to €146 million 
(2022: €410 million), and a decrease in provisions fo r personnel-related restructuring measures to 
€615 million (2022: €750 million). Other miscellaneous pr ovisions fell to €708 million (2022:  €1,128 million), 
mainly due to a decline in provisions  for the assumption of costs for re structuring measures to €97 million 
(2022: €459 million), and a decrease in provisions for impe nding losses to €453 million (2022: 
€589 million). 
Liabilities and deferred income – net of deductib le receivables – fell to €55,698 million (2022: 
€60,909 million). Five new bonds with  a total volume of €4,750 million we re issued in 2023. In addition, 
two existing hybrid bonds issued in 2014 and 2019 were pa rtially repurchased (vol ume of €1,389 million). 
As such, the total volume of outstanding bonds in creased to €17,911 million (2022: €14,550 million). 
Liabilities to banks declined from €3,000 million to € 27 million (2022: €3,009 million), mainly due to the 
repayment of loans. The decline in trade accounts pa yable to €2,118 million (2022: €2,164 million) mainly 
pertained to trade accounts payable to subsidiaries. Paya bles to subsidiaries fell to €34,814 million (2022: 
€40,579 million), largely due to a d ecline in loans to €32,468 million (2 022: €36,107 million). Miscellaneous 
liabilities rose to €803 m illion (2022: €521 millio n), mainly because of additions to commercial paper. 
Financial obligations declined to €56,777 million (2022:  €57,894 million). Intra-Gr oup financial obligations 
decreased by €1,794 million to €38,445 million, with short-term loans ac counting for €4,485 million of this 
figure, the increase in liabilities from call deposits fo r €1,845 million, and higher loan liabilities for €846 
million. Liabilities to third parties rose by €677 million to €18,332 million, with th e €3,361 million increase in 
liabilities for bonds to €17,911 million partially offset by the €2,982 millio n decline in loans from banks to 
€27 million, as the primary factor. In addition, there was a €311 million increase in commercial paper. Net 
debt increased to €52,440 million (2 022: €50,621 million) after dedu ction of €4,337 million (2022: 
€7,273 million) in cash and cash equi valents and marketable securities. 
Since all of the own shares acquired in 2023 were su bsequently resold, the trans actions were not reflected 
in equity at the closing date. Details are provided in the stock-based compensation section of the “Equity” chapter in the Notes to the Financial Statements of Bayer AG.

Bayer AG is largely exposed to the same opportunities  and risks as the Bayer Group. In addition to the 
following statements, please also r efer to the “Report on Future Perspe ctives and on Opportunities and 
Risks” section on the Bayer Group. 
Our strategy is subject to regular review to ensure adjustments can be made to reflect changes that arise 
across the economic and political land scape. We are currently working on a radical realignment of our 
operating model as a top priority. This new model, which we call Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO), will 
put patients, farmers and consumers front and center,  while also accelerating the pace of innovation and 
unlocking the potential of each and every employee. The DSO model envisages that  our employees work in 
small, self-managed teams that are focused on a custom er or a product. Activities are prioritized on the 
basis of their contribution to the mission, and progre ss is measured in short, 90-day cycles, giving us 
much greater agility. It also enab les us to eliminate coordination work and reduce management layers. 
Personnel-related expenses for termination agreements  in connection with the transformation are taken 
into account in the forecast. 
Bayer AG is expected to generate sales of approxim ately €15.5 billion and an op erating loss of around 
€2.5 billion in 2024. These figures in clude Bayer AG’s own operational business and the businesses leased 
from Bayer CropScience AG and Bayer Pharma AG. 
For Bayer AG, we expect slight sales declines for Xa relto™ and Adalat™ in the Pharmaceuticals Division in 
2024, which will be also reflected in operating earnings.  Sales from the intra-Grou p charging-on of services 
will be at approximately the same level as in 2023. Internal sales in the Crop Science Division will also 
decline slightly, which will additionally  lead to a slight deterioration in operating earnings. In addition, the 
earnings of most German subsidiaries are transferred directly to Bayer AG under profit and loss transfer 
and control agreements. On account of  the interdependencies between Bayer AG and its subsidiaries, the 
outlook for the Bayer Group thus la rgely also reflects the expectations  for Bayer AG. Bayer AG plans to 
amend its dividend policy to pay out the legally required minimum in 2024.

1 The endorsement process of the European Union is still pending. 
In May 2023, the IASB published am endments to IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows) and IFRS 7 (Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures) with a new disclosure requirement for supplier fi nance arrangements. These 
amendments to IAS 7 add a disclosure requirement st ating that a company must disclose information on 
its supplier finance arrangements that enables users of its financial statements to assess the impact of 
these arrangements on the company’s liabilities and cas h flows. In addition, IFRS 7 was amended to add 
supplier finance arrangements as an example within  the requirement to disclose information about a 
company’s exposure to concentration of liquidity risk. To meet this disclosure requirement, Bayer will 
report the relevant information for any supplier finan ce arrangements of material importance for the Bayer 
Group. The changes are not expected to significantly affect the presentati on of the Bayer Group’s financial 
position or results of operations.   
3. Reporting policies, method s and critical accounting 
estimates 
The consolidated financial statements as of Decem ber 31, 2023, of Bayer AG and its subsidiaries  
(Bayer Group) were prepared accordin g to the International Financial Repo rting Standards (IFRS) issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, United Kingdom, and the interpretations of 
the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as endorsed and adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2023. The applicable fu rther requirements of Section 315e of the German Commercial Code 
were also taken into account. 
The consolidated financial statemen ts were drawn up in euros. Excep t where otherwise indicated, amounts 
are stated in millions of euros (€ m illion) and rounded to the nearest mil lion. Adding the individual figures 
may therefore not always result  in the exact total given. 
In the income statement and statement of compre hensive income, statement of financial position, 
statement of cash flows and statemen t of changes in equity, certain it ems are combined for the sake of 
clarity. These are explained in the Notes. The inco me statement was prepared using the cost-of-sales 
method. Assets and liabilities are classified by maturity. They are regarded as current  if they mature within 
one year or within the normal business cycle, which us ually does not exceed one y ear, or are held for sale. 
The normal business cycle is defined for this purpose as beginning with the procurement of the resources 
necessary for the production process and ending with the receipt of cash or cash equivalents as 
consideration for the sale of the goods or services  produced in that proce ss. Inventories and trade 
accounts receivable and payable are always presented as current items. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
and pension provisions are always presented as noncurrent items. 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 141
The financial statements of the individual compan ies consolidated are prep ared according to uniform 
recognition and measurement methods.  The consolidated financial statem ents are based on the principle 
of the historical cost of acquisition, construction or production, with the exception of the items reflected at fair value, such as equity instrument s held, debt instruments held that do  not solely comprise principal and 
interest payments, and derivatives and liabilities that must be recognized or were designated at fair value 
through profit or loss. 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements , management must make certain assumptions and 
estimates that may substantially impact the presentation  of the Group’s financial position and/or results of 
operations. Such estimates, assumptions or the exercise  of discretion mainly relate to the useful life of 
noncurrent assets, the discounted cash flows used fo r impairment testing and pu rchase price allocations, 
and the recognition of pr ovisions, including those for litigation- related expenses, pensions and other 
benefits, taxes, environmental compliance and remediat ion costs, product liability and guarantees, as well 
as the recognition of refund liabilities. 
Essential estimates and assumptions that may affect re porting in the various it em categories of the 
financial statements are described in the following sections of this Note. Estimates are based on historical 
experience and other assumptions th at are considered reasonable und er given circumstances. They are 
continually reviewed but may vary from the actual values. 
New or revised financial reporting standards often cont ain options regarding the first-time application of 
new recognition and measurement meth ods. The income statement for th e previous year and the opening 
statement of financial position for that year may be adjusted depending on the option Bayer exercises. For 
further information on the standards applied for the first time as of January 1, 2023, see Note [2]. 
Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements  include subsidiaries, joint operatio ns, joint ventures and associates. 
The financial statements of the individual companies co nsolidated are prepared as of the closing date of 
the Group financial statements. If financial statements  of joint ventures and associates have a different 
closing date, adjustments are made for material transa ctions or events between that date and the closing 
date of the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group. 
Subsidiaries are companies over which Bayer AG is curre ntly able to exercise powe r by virtue of existing 
rights. Power means the ability to di rect the relevant activities th at significantly affect a company’s 
profitability. Control is therefore only deemed to exist if Bayer AG is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvem ent with a company and has the ability to use its power over that company to 
affect the amount of that company’s returns. The abilit y to control another company generally derives from 
Bayer AG’s direct or indirect ownership of a majority of the voting rights. In the case of structured entities, however, control is based on contra ctual agreements. Inclusion of an en tity’s accounts in the consolidated 
financial statements begins when th e Bayer Group is able to exercise control over the entity and ceases 
when it is no long er able to do so. 
A joint operation or a joint venture exists where the Bayer Group controls an entity’s activities jointly with a 
third party on the basis of a contra ctual agreement and decisions about th e relevant activities require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The parties to a joint operation have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arra ngement. The Bayer Group r ecognizes its share of the 
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the cons olidated financial statemen ts in accordance with its 
rights and obligations. The parties jointly controlling a joint venture have  rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement. Joint ventures are acco unted for using the equity method . Associates are companies over 
which Bayer Group companies hold a voting interest of between 20% and 50% or for which there are relevant indicators of significan t influence. They also are accounted  for using the equity method. The 
carrying amount of a company accounted for using the eq uity method is adjusted monthly by the change 
in its equity corresponding to Baye r’s percentage interest in the comp any. Differences arising upon first-
time inclusion using the equity me thod are accounted for according to full- consolidation principles. Bayer’s 
share of changes – recognized in profit or loss – in these companies’ equity, in cluding impairment losses 
recognized on goodwill, are reflect ed in equity-method income/loss. Gains and losses arising from the 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 142
remeasurement of investments accounted for using the equity method due to Baye r obtaining control or 
losing significant influence are also reflected in equi ty-method income/loss. Gain s and losses from the sale 
of investments accounted fo r using the equity method are recogn ized in equity-met hod income/loss. 
Interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates  that do not have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial position or results of operations, either in dividually or in aggregate,  are not consolidated but 
recognized as financial invest ments in equity instruments. 
Foreign currency translation 
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that do  not use the euro as thei r functional currency are 
translated into euros at closing rate s. All changes occurring during th e year and all income and expense 
items and cash flows are translated into euros at average monthly rates. For subsidiaries with a 
hyperinflationary functional currency, currencies are always translated at the respective closing rates. 
Equity components are translated at  the historical exchange rates prevailing at the respective dates of 
their first-time recognit ion in Group equity. The exchange di fferences arising between the resulting 
amounts and those obtained by tran slating at closing rates are recogn ized outside profit or loss as 
“Exchange differences on translation of operations outside the eurozone ” (in other comprehensive income) 
or presented as “Exchange differences” in the tables in the Notes. When a company is deconsolidated, 
such exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized in other operating 
income/expenses. When capital repayments of a net investment in a foreign op eration are effected but the 
percentage of shares owned remains unchanged, ex change differences are reclassified from other 
comprehensive income to profit or loss and recogniz ed on a prorated basis under exchange gains or 
losses in other financial income and expenses within the financial result.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 143
The following companies have a hype rinflationary functional currency: 
B 3/2 
Application of IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflation Economies) 
Company name Place of business Applied since
Bayer S. A. Buenos Aires,  Argentina July 1, 2018
Bayer Türk Kimya Sanayii Limited Sirketi Istanbul, Turkey April 1, 2022
Monsanto Gida Ve Tarim Ticaret Ltd Sirketi Istanbul, Turkey April 1, 2022
Bayer Tohumculuk ve Tarim Limited Sirketi Istanbul, Turkey March 7, 2023
   
    
Hyperinflationary accounting is applied for these compan ies pursuant to IAS 29. On the date of first-time 
application, the adjustment of th e carrying amounts of nonmonetary as sets and liabilities was recognized 
in equity based on the general price index. The effect s in initial accounting are immaterial for the Group. 
Gains and losses incurred from the current hyperinflation of nonmonet ary assets and liabilities and of 
equity are recognized in the income statement as other operating income and expenses. 
In Argentina, hyperinflation is based on the index “I PC Nacional Empalme IPIM” (2017=100) with an index 
value of 3,533 as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 20 22: 1,135), and an annual inflation rate of 211% 
(2022: 95%). In Turkey, hyperinflation is based on the “Consumer price index (2003=100)” with an index value of 1,859 as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 1,128), and an annual inflation rate of 65% 
(2022: 64%). 
Foreign currency measurement 
Monetary items, such as receivabl es and liabilities, that are denomi nated in currencies other than a 
Group company’s functional currency are measured at  closing rates. Related exchange differences are 
recognized as exchange gains or losses un der other financial income or expenses. 
Sales, refund liabilities, right-of-return assets and contract liabilities 
All revenues derived from the selling of products, render ing of services or from licensing agreements are 
recognized as sales. Revenues are based on cu stomer contracts and the performance obligations 
contained therein, which are individually identified and may be presented separa tely for the purpose of 
revenue recognition. Revenues are recognized in profit  or loss when or as soon as the entity transfers 
control of goods or services to a customer either over time or at a point in time. Control lies with the 
customer if the customer can independently determin e the use of, and consume the benefit derived from, 
a product or service. Revenues from product deliveries are recognized at a point in time based on an overall assessment of the existence of a right to payment, the allocation of ownership rights, the transfer of physical possession, the transfer of  risks and rewards, and acceptance by the customer. In the case of 
product deliveries undertaken by the Bayer Group, th e transfer of risks and rewards and the right to 
determine the product shipment destination are partic ularly important. Depending on the transfer of 
control, revenues from services are r ecognized either at a point in time or over the period of time when 
services are rendered and in accordance wi th a reasonable measure of progress. 
Net sales are limited to the amount the Bayer Group expects to receive for the fulfillment of performance 
obligations. Payment components to be withheld fo r third parties are deducted. Sales are therefore 
reduced by sales taxes and by actual and expected sa les deductions resulting from rebates, discounts 
and bonuses. Furthermore, sales are reduced by the amo unt of the refund liability for expected returns of 
defective goods or of saleable products that may be returned under contractual arrangements, with this 
reduction taking place at the date of revenue recognit ion or when a reliable estimate can be made. Refund 
liabilities are recognized for expected  sales deductions and product retu rns. Sales deductions and refund 
liabilities are estimated primarily on the basis of hist orical experience, specific contractual terms, price 
information and thus future expectations of sales development. The underlyin g assumptions applied for 
refund liabilities are reviewed at each cl osing date and revised where necessary.  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 144
Assets from expected product returns are recognized in inventories as right-of-return assets at the 
previous carrying amounts less any recovery and pr ocessing costs and potential impairments. For 
unilaterally fulfilled customer contracts where more  than one year passes between performance and 
payment, significant financing comp onents are accounted for separately based on their present values and 
the subsequent unwinding of the discount. The underlyin g discount rate takes into account the individual 
credit risk of the contracting part y that receives the financing. Revenues from contracts involving noncash 
consideration, such as exchange tr ansactions, are measured at the fair value of the assets received or the 
right to receive them. 
Some of the Bayer Group’s revenues are generated on the basis of licensing agreements under which third 
parties have been granted the right to use or access products and te chnologies. A right-to-use license is 
characterized by the underlying tec hnology remaining essentially unchang ed over the period for which the 
rights are granted. With a right-to- access license, by contrast, the customer ’s interest is directed toward 
the consistent further deve lopment of that intellectual property. Re venues from right-to-use licenses are 
recognized at a specific point in time, while those from right-to-access licenses ar e recognized over time 
according to the underlying measure of progress. M ilestone payments relate d to right-to-access licenses 
are allocated to satisfied and unsatis fied portions of the underlying pe rformance obligation, as applicable. 
Consideration relating to already satisfied obligations is recognized as catch-up adjustments to revenue. 
Payment elements still to be earned are deferred as co ntract liabilities. Sales- or usage-based royalties 
agreed in connection with outlicensi ng arrangements are only recogniz ed if the sale or the usage is 
sufficiently verified and the underlying pe rformance obligation has been fulfilled. 
In the Crop Science segment, Bayer conducts barter  transactions in certain geographies to grant its 
customers longer payment terms while at the same ti me reducing the credit risk. For example, payment 
may be made in the form of a subsequent delivery of soybeans or corn, or crops may be pledged as 
collateral. Any commodity-price risk that Bayer is ex posed to as a result is hedged using derivatives. 
Changes in the fair value of these de rivatives are recognized in other operating income and expenses. If 
Bayer assumes control of goods (such as soybeans) in stead of receiving a cash payment, their resale is 
accounted for in other operating in come, and their derecognition in other operating expenses, since 
transactions of this nature do not form part of normal business operations. 
Research and development expenses 
Research expenses are recognized th rough profit or loss. Development expenses are only capitalized as 
internally generated intangible assets if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) are met. These include sufficient certainty that the de velopment activity will give rise to future financial cash flows that also 
cover the respective development expenses. Since ou r own development projects are often subject to 
regulatory approval proced ures and other uncertainties, the condit ions for the capitalization of costs 
incurred before receipt of approval s generally are not satisfied.  
Development costs for internal so ftware projects can be capitalized . Costs in connection with the 
implementation of cloud applications  are usually recognized through prof it or loss. If the definitions and 
recognition criteria of IAS 38 are met, which can be the case with interfaces, fo r example, the costs are 
capitalized as an intangible asset. Capitalized de velopment expenses are recognized at the cost of 
generation and amortized over their expected useful lives. Impairment testing is also performed on an annual or event-driven basis. 
Income taxes 
Income taxes comprise the taxes levied on taxable in come in the individual co untries along with changes 
in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recognized in profit or loss. This al so includes current income 
taxes resulting from tax laws that have come into fo rce or been adopted to implement the Pillar Two Model 
Rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The income taxes recognized are reflected at the amounts likely to be payable under the statut ory regulations in force, 
or already enacted in relation to future periods, at the end of the reporting period. Complex tax regulations 
may give rise to uncertainties with respect to their interpretation and the amounts and timing of future 
taxable income. Given the wide range of internationa l business relationships and the long-term nature and 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 145
complexity of existing contractual agreements, di fferences arising between th e actual results and the 
assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate adjustments to tax income and expense in future periods. Liab ilities to tax authorities that are un certain as to their amount and the 
probability of their occurrence are r ecognized as tax liabilities base d on reasonable estimates. The 
amounts recognized are based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits and 
differing legal interpretations by the taxable entity and th e responsible tax authority. 
In compliance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes), deferre d taxes are recognized for temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position prepared 
according to IFRS and their tax bases.  Deferred taxes are also recognized  for loss carryforwards, interest 
carryforwards and tax credits that are likely to be us able. Based on the exception stated in IAS 12.4A, 
deferred taxes related to Pillar Two are not recognized nor is informat ion thereon disclosed. Deferred tax 
assets relating to deductible temporary differen ces, tax credits, loss carry forwards and interest 
carryforwards are recognized  where it is probable that taxable in come or sufficientl y taxable temporary 
differences will be available in the future to enable th em to be used. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized 
on temporary differences taxable in the future. Deferred taxes are calcula ted at the rates which – on the 
basis of the statutory regulations in fo rce, or already enacted in relation to  future periods, as of the closing 
date – are expected to apply in the individual countries at the time of realization. Deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities are offset if Bayer has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and these are le vied by the same taxation authorit y. Material effects of changes in tax 
rates or tax law on deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally accounted for in the period in which the 
changes are enacted. Such effects are recognized in prof it or loss except where they relate to deferred 
taxes that were recognized outside profit or lo ss, in which case they are recognized in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.  
Deferred and current taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they relate to items recognized outside 
profit or loss in other compre hensive income, in which case they , too, are recognized in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity. The probability that deferred ta x assets resulting from 
temporary differences, loss carryforwards  or interest carryforwards can be used in the future is the subject 
of forecasts by the individual consolidated companie s regarding their future ear nings situation and other 
parameters. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on planned dividend payments by subsidiaries. Where 
no dividend payment is planned for the foreseeable fu ture, no deferred tax liability is recognized on the 
difference between the proportionate ne t assets according to IFRS and the tax base of the investment in 
the subsidiary. 
Goodwill  
In a business combination, goodwill is capitalized at the acquisition date (see “Acquisition accounting”). 
Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication of 
possible impairment. 
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 146
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are capitalized at the acquisiti on date at their cost of acquisition or generation. 
Those with a definite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following  periods, except 
where their actual depletion demands a different amortization pattern. 
B 3/3 
Useful Lives of Other Intangible Assets 
Patents and technologies 8 to 30 years
Trademarks 10 to 35 years
Marketing and distribution rights, customer relationships 5 to 30 years
Production rights 14 to 19 years
Other rights 2 to 12 years
  
    
The expected useful lives of such assets and the amor tization patterns are determined based on estimates 
of the period for which they will generate cash flows. In addition, a review is conducted as of each closing 
date to ascertain whether there ar e any indications of impairment, and impairment testing may then 
potentially be performed. 
Should inlicensing result in consideration for the acquisiti on of intellectual property, this is capitalized as an 
intangible asset. If the transaction also includes  research and development activities, the share of 
consideration attributable to these activities is deferred and recognized  through profit and loss according 
to the utilization thereof. 
If separately capitalizable intangible assets are acqui red within the scope of software projects (such as 
S/4HANA implementation), the related costs are correspondingly capitalized. 
Emission allowances meet the criteria of intangible a ssets and are not subject to amortization due to their 
indefinite useful life. If emission allowances are gr anted to the company free of  charge by a statutory 
authority in connection with regulatory requirements , like the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), no 
amount is recognized for emission allowances. If mo re emissions are emitted th an the allocated emission 
allowances permit, additional allowances are purcha sed and recognized as intangible assets at cost. 
Corresponding provisions are recognized in the peri od in which the emissions are emitted and usually 
reflect the cost of acquisition of the emission certifi cates. If the emissions in a specific period exceed the 
corresponding emission allowances, this portion of th e provision is measured at the current market value 
of the allowances. When the allowa nces are retired, the intangible assets are derecognized and the 
corresponding provisions are reversed. 
CO 2 certificates that are acquired or produced to meet our voluntary climate target s in connection with our 
greenhouse gas reduction program, including renewable energy certificates, are re cognized as intangible 
assets at cost and derecognized agai nst the relevant functional costs in the event of retirement. If they are 
used in the production process or are intended for sa le within the normal course of business, they are 
recognized in inventories. If the certificates are retired immediately up on acquisition for the purpose of 
offsetting, they are recognized directly in functional costs. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is initially recognized at  the cost of acquisition or construction plus the 
estimated amounts of any redevelopm ent or decommissioning costs. Ther eafter it is depreciated by the 
straight-line method over its ex pected useful life, except where use-related depreciation is more 
appropriate. 
B 3/4 
Useful Life of Property, Plant and Equipment 
Buildings 5 to 50 years
Plant installations and machinery 4 to 40 years
Furniture, fixtures and other equipment 2 to 15 years
  
    
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 147
A review is conducted as of each closing date to  ascertain whether there are any indications of 
impairment. When assets are sold, closed down or  scrapped, the difference between the net proceeds 
and the net carrying amount of the assets is recognized  as a gain or loss in other operating income or 
expenses, respectively.  
Grants and subsidies from third parties that serve to promote investment are reflected in the statement 
of financial position under other liabilities and amortize d to income over the usefu l lives of the respective 
investments in property, plant or equipment, or in line with the terms of the grant or subsidy. 
Investment property comprises land  and buildings not being used for operational or administrative 
purposes. It is measured using the cost model. The fair value of this property reported in the Notes is 
primarily determined on the basis of internal valu ations using the income approach, while that of 
undeveloped sites is mainly calculated using the market comparison approach. 
Impairment testing 
An impairment test is performed if there is an indi cation of possible impairment for an intangible asset, 
an item of property, plant and equipment, or a cash-generating unit or unit group to which goodwill has 
been allocated. Other intangible assets with an ind efinite useful life (such as the Bayer Cross trademark), 
intangible assets that are not yet available for use (such as R&D projects) and cash-generating units or 
unit groups to which goodwill has been allocated are additionally tested annually for impairment. 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable grou p of assets generating cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bayer Group primarily regards 
product families as well as seeds and the corresponding traits as cash-generatin g units and subjects them 
to impairment testing. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting segment level. 
Impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit or unit group, 
intangible asset or item of property, plant and equipm ent to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of 
its fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.  If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, 
an impairment loss must be recognized for the di fference. In this case an impairment loss is first 
recognized on any goodwill allocated  to the cash-generating unit or unit group. Any remaining impairment 
loss is allocated among the other noncurrent nonfinancial assets in proportion to their carrying amounts, unless this is prohibited under any other rule. The re sulting expense is reflected in the operating expense 
item in which the depreciation or amortization of th e respective asset is recogn ized. The same applies to 
income from impairment loss reversals. Impairment  losses recognized on goodw ill are included in other 
operating expenses. 
The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of the fair valu e less costs of disposal, 
taking into account the present value of the future net cash flows as market prices for the individual units 
are not normally available. These are forecasted on the basis of the Bayer Group’s current planning, which 
has a planning horizon of up to four years and includes  exchange rate assumptions at the time of planning. 
Forecasting involves making assumpti ons, especially regarding future se lling prices, sales volumes, costs, 
market growth rates and eco nomic cycles. These assumptions are base d on internal estimates along with 
external market studies. Where the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs of disposal, 
measurement is undertaken from the viewpoint of  an independent market participant. Where 
the recoverable amount is the value in use, the object of valuation is measured as  currently used. In either 
case, net cash flows beyond the planning period ar e determined on the basis of long-term business 
expectations using individually calcu lated growth rates. The fair value less costs of disposal is determined 
on the basis of unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 148
The net cash inflows are discounted at  a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt 
capital. To allow for the different ri sk and return profiles of the Baye r Group’s principal businesses, the 
after-tax cost of capital is calculated separately for each report ing segment and certain cash-generating 
units and unit groups while taking into account re gional focus areas, and a segment-specific capital 
structure is defined by benchmarking  against comparable companies in th e same industry sector. The cost 
of equity corresponds to the return expected by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the 
conditions on which comparable co mpanies can obtain long-term financ ing. Both components are derived 
from capital market information. 
Although the estimates of the useful lives of certain assets, assumptions concerning the macroeconomic 
environment and industry developments, and estimates of the discounted future cash flows are believed to 
be appropriate, changes in assump tions or circumstances could requir e changes in the carrying amounts. 
This could lead to the recognition of additional impairment losses in the future or – except in the case of 
goodwill – to reversals of previous ly recognized impairment losses. 
Leases 
A lease is established by a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
period of time in exchange for consideration. 
As lessee, Bayer generally recognizes the present value of the future lease payments as a financial liability. 
The lease payments are split into principal and intere st portions according to th e effective-interest method. 
In line with this and taking into acco unt any further cost components, the right-of-use asset (the asset that 
reflects the right to use the underlying asset) is capit alized under property, plant and equipment at the 
inception of the lease. The right-of-use asset is re cognized at amortized cost  and depreciated by the 
straight-line method. 
Use is made of the recognition exemptions for certain  leases in which the underlying assets are of low 
value and also for short-term leas es. The lease payments under these contracts are recognized as other 
operating expenses on a straight -line basis over the lease term. 
Bayer exercises the accounting policy op tion under IFRS 16 (Leases) availabl e for lessees not to apply this 
standard to leases of intangible assets. 
For certain contracts with  both lease and nonlease components, Bayer as lessee applies the practical 
expedient not to separate these components but to recognize them collectiv ely as a single lease 
component.  
Payments under intra-Group leases ar e generally presented as expenses or  income in segment reporting in 
line with the internal reporting system. 
Lease contracts in which Bayer acts as  the lessor and substantially all th e risks and rewards of utilizing the 
underlying asset are transferred to the lessee are classi fied as finance leases. The net investment in the 
lease is recognized as a receivable. In the case of op erating leases where Bayer is the lessor, the leased 
assets continue to be capitalized, and the lease paym ents are recognized in in come on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. 
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 149
Financial assets 
Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equi ty and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents, 
and derivatives with positive fair valu es. A financial asset is initially rec ognized on the settlement date at fair 
value, plus transactio n costs in most cases. 
The classification and measurement of financial asse ts is based in each case on the business model and 
the characteristics of the cash flo ws. Trade accounts receivable and othe r debt instruments are measured 
at amortized cost using the effective-interest method, at  fair value through profit  or loss (such as money 
market funds and effective initial funds) or at fair valu e through other comprehensiv e income (such as trade 
accounts receivable that can potentially be transferred as  part of factoring agreemen ts). Equity instruments 
are generally held for medium- to long-term strategic purposes and are therefore measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income. Otherwise, they are measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
like for example the shares in Century Therapeutics, In c., United States, and Pyxi s Oncology, Inc., United 
States. 
Under the simplified impairment model, a default on receivables measured at amortized cost using the 
effective-interest method that is expected over the resp ective term (stage 2 of the impairment model) is 
determined for trade accounts receivable based on port folio-specific default rates. These expected default 
rates are mainly based on the aver age defaults on receivables in recen t years. These default rates are 
adjusted during the year for the respective customer port folio if a significant change in the default rate is 
expected in the future. In determining the expect ed default rates, we take into account the business 
model, the respective customer and the economic environment of the geog raphic region. This is achieved 
by applying specific default rate s for the individual Group compan ies and, in the case of smaller 
companies, making a standard calcula tion in countries with a comparable  credit risk. Furth er differentiation 
is achieved by taking into account the segments’ vari ous customer groups. Thro ughout the Bayer Group, 
customers are also assigned to risk classes with different expected default rates depending on their 
individual credit risk assessments. 
Where action such as insolv ency or comparable proceedings has been  initiated against a defaulter or other 
objective indications exist that receivables are impaired (such as a cons iderable worsening of 
creditworthiness or a financial restruct uring), the receivables are individua lly tested for impairment (stage 3 
of the impairment model). In addition, all receivables mo re than 90 days past due ar e individually tested for 
impairment during the year. 
For other financial assets measured at amortized cost, the expected credit losses that would result from 
potential default events within th e next 12 months – as determined  using the Monte Carlo simulation 
method – are recognized through profit or loss on first-time recognition and on subsequent measurement 
(stage 1 of the impairment model). In the event of a si gnificant increase in the default risk, which is defined 
as a more than 0.25% increase in th e probability of default with respect to the default risk on first-time 
recognition, assets are reclassified  to stage 2 of the impairment model, taking into account the expected 
credit losses over the respective asset maturities. An impairment loss is recogniz ed if there are objective 
indications of an impairment.  
Financial assets are derecognized when contractual ri ghts to receive cash flows fr om the financial assets 
expire or the financial assets were transferred together  with all material risks and benefits. Receivables are 
also derecognized if they have been finally assesse d as irrecoverable and we have ceased efforts to collect 
them following the completion of insolvency proceedings, for example.  Receivables are not derecognized 
while they remain subject to enforcement. 
Inventories 
Inventories are recognized at their cost of acquisition or production (production-related full costs) – calculated by the weighted-average method – or at their net realizable value, whichever is lower. 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 150
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash includes cash in hand, checks received and bala nces with banks and companies. Cash equivalents 
are financial investments with maximum maturities of  three months from the acq uisition date that are 
subject to no more than insignifi cant fluctuations in value and will gi ve rise to predefined cash inflows. 
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost. 
Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
Within the Bayer Group, post-employm ent benefits are provided under d efined contribution and/or defined 
benefit plans. In the case of define d contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or 
privately administered pension plans on a mandat ory, contractual or vo luntary basis. Once the 
contributions have been paid, the company has no fu rther payment obligations. The regular contributions 
constitute operating expenses and as such are included in the resp ective income statement items.  
All remaining commitments under pension and other po st-employment benefit plans are measured in terms 
of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) using the projected unit credit method, with entitlements already earned being measured at the present value of the DBO.  This is based on factors such as expected future 
salary and pension increases, changes in healthcare co sts, mortality rates and be neficiary structure. The 
uniform discount rates are based on the yields of high-quality bond portfolios (AA-rated corporate bonds) 
in specific currencies, extrapolated where necessary to cover the future peri od for which sufficiently 
accurate bond yields are not availabl e. Where there is insufficient empiri cal data on corporate bond yields 
with longer-term residual maturities , the yield structure is derived fr om government bond yields plus 
spread to reflect the higher risk of default. The bond  portfolios consist of bond s with weighted residual 
maturities approximately equal to the duration of the expected disbursements from the pension plans. The 
pension service cost and the net interest on the net liability are determined on the basis of the 
assumptions as of the previous closing date. 
For funded obligations, the net liability is determined  by deducting the fair value of plan assets. The 
obligations and plan assets are measured at regular in tervals. Where no quoted pri ces for plan assets exist 
in active markets, their fair values are determined by  applying the usual measur ement methods and on the 
basis of freely accessible data such as interest rate curves and credit spreads.  The net defined benefit 
asset is recognized in other receivables.  
Current and past service cost and effects of plan se ttlements are recognized in operating income.  
The net interest on the net liability is reflected in the financial result under other financial income and 
expenses. The effects of remeasurements of the net defi ned benefit liability are reflected in the statement 
of comprehensive income as other comprehensive income. They consist of actuarial gains and losses, the 
return on plan assets and change s in the effects of the asset ceiling, less the amounts included in net 
interest and related deferred taxes. 
Other provisions  
Other provisions are recogniz ed for present legal and constructive obligations arising from past events that 
will probably give rise to a future outf low of resources, provided that a re liable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligations. They are established at the present value of  the expected future cash outflows 
and recognized in the respective operating expense item s. The interest cost is reflected in the financial 
result under other financial income and expenses. If the projected oblig ation declines as a result of a 
change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by  the corresponding amount and the resulting income 
recognized in the operating ex pense item(s) in which the orig inal charge was recognized. 
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 151
Costs arising from obligations to decommission or di smantle property, plant an d equipment are included 
as a component of the acquisition or construction costs for property, plant or equipment if they can be reliably estimated, and are covered by provisions. If ch anges in the estimates require the provisions to be 
adjusted, the carrying amounts of the respective  assets are reduced or increased accordingly. 
Estimating the future costs for en vironmental protection and similar m easures involves, in particular, 
uncertainties with regard to the a pplicable laws and regulations and the actual local conditions. Significant 
factors in estimating the costs includ e previous experiences in similar cas es, expert opinions, current costs 
and new developments affecting costs, management’s inte rpretation of current en vironmental regulations, 
the financial position of third parties that may become  obligated to participate in any remediation costs on 
the basis of joint liability, and the remediation methods likely to be depl oyed. Changes in these 
assumptions could impact future reported results of  the Group. Taking into consideration the experience 
gained to date and the knowledge and circumstances as of the closing da te, provisions are believed to be 
adequate. However, material addition al costs could be incurred beyond the amounts accrued that result in 
additional expenses in subsequent periods. 
Provisions for employee termination benefits are established where the amounts of severance payments, 
additional pension plan modules to be granted or oth er benefits can be reliably estimated. However, 
material additional costs could be incurred beyond the amounts accrued that  result in additional expenses 
in subsequent periods. 
Obligations arising from stock-based programs that involve cash settlement pursuant to IFRS 2 (Share-
based Payment) are covered by provisions in the amount of the fair value of the obligations existing as of the closing date. All resultin g changes in value are recogn ized in profit or loss. 
Provisions for litigations are established under certain conditions in the case of legal risks. Litigations and 
other judicial proceedings often raise complex i ssues and are subject to many uncertainties and 
complexities including, but not limited to, the fact s and circumstances of each particular case, the 
jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law. The outcome of  any current or 
future proceedings cann ot normally be predicted. It is particular ly difficult to assess th e likely outcomes of 
class actions for damages or mass compensation clai ms in the United States, which may give rise to 
significant financial risks for the Ba yer Group. As a result of a fina l judgment in court proceedings, 
regulatory decisions or the conclusion of a settlem ent, the Bayer Group may in cur charges for which no 
accounting measures have yet been taken for lack of  reasonable estimability or which exceed presently 
established provisions and the insurance coverage. 
The Bayer Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of  pending or future litigations, 
and the extent of any such measures , on the basis of the information av ailable to its legal department and 
in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Bayer Group. Where it is more likely than not that 
such a litigation will result in an ou tflow of resources that is already r easonably estimable, a provision for 
litigation is recorded in the amount  of the present value of the expect ed cash outflows. Such provisions 
cover the estimated payments to the plaintiffs, court an d procedural costs, attorn ey costs and the cost of 
potential settlements. 
It is sometimes impossible to reliably determine th e existence of a present obligation or reasonably 
estimate the probability that a potential outflow of reso urces will result from a pend ing or future litigation. 
The status of the material “legal risks” is descri bed in Note [30]. Due to the special nature of these 
litigations, provisions generally are not established unt il initial settlements allow an estimate of potential 
amounts or judgments have been issued . Provisions for legal defense costs are established if it is probable 
that material costs will have to be incurred for external legal counsel to defend the company’s legal 
position.  
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 152
Internal and external legal counsel ev aluate the current status of the Bayer Group’s material legal risks at 
the end of each reporting period. Th e need to establish or adjust a provision and the amount of the 
provision or adjustment are determin ed on this basis. Adjusting events  are reflected up to the date of 
preparation of the consolidated fina ncial statements. The measurement of  provisions in the case of class 
actions or mass compensation claims  is mainly based on any settleme nts reached during the past year 
and on pending or anticipated future claims. With respect to the proceedings outlined in Note [30] “Legal 
risks”, further information on litigations, estimated fi nancial effects, uncertainties and contingent liabilities, 
as well as the recognition and amounts of individual  provisions, can be withheld under IAS 37.92 if 
disclosing it could significantly prejudice the company’s position. 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are generally measured at am ortized cost using the effe ctive-interest method. 
Derivatives with negative fair values, liabilities for co ntingent consideration in business combinations and 
liabilities designated at fair value through pr ofit or loss are measured at fair value. 
Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contr actual obligation is discharg ed or canceled, or has 
expired. 
Supply chain financing programs (also known as reve rse factoring) are used in the Bayer Group that 
enable suppliers to choose to have individual invoi ces paid prior to their due date. As part of such 
programs, the supplier concludes a financing agreement with a bank or platform operator without Bayer’s 
involvement and, upon request, is paid the invoi ce amount by the bank in advance less an interest 
component. Bayer generally pays th e invoice amount to the bank when due; the payment deadlines lie 
within the usual scope for the indu stry. Bayer has assessed these progra ms based on various criteria and 
concluded that the associated liabilities retain th e character of trade accounts payable. The related 
payments to the bank are therefore classified  as a cash outflow from operating activities. 
Derivatives 
The Bayer Group uses derivatives to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates, interest rates or 
commodity prices (such as for soyb eans and corn) and to hedge the st ock-based compensation programs 
issued until 2020. The instruments us ed include forward exchange contr acts, interest-rate swaps, forward 
commodity contracts and forward stoc k transactions. Derivatives are rec ognized at the trade date and are 
remeasured to fair value on each closin g date. Positive fair values are reflected in financial assets, negative 
fair values in financial liabilities.  
Contracts for the purchase and sale of nonfinancial items (such as raw material  supply contracts) that are 
concluded for the company’s own purp oses are treated as pending trans actions (own-use exemption) and 
not accounted for as derivatives. Other contracts for the purchase and sale of nonfinancial items are 
accounted for as derivatives at fair value through pr ofit or loss under certain  conditions (such as 
nonfulfillment of own-use exemption). 
Where embedded derivatives are identified in co ntracts, they are assesse d for any close economic 
relationship with the host contract. If no such rela tionship is found, they are accounted for separately as 
derivatives. Embedded derivatives that are contained in  financial assets are not separated; instead, the 
entire instrument is measured at fair value through profit and loss. 
Such host contracts are generally sa le or purchase agreements relating to the operational business. The 
embedded derivatives cause the cash flows from the contracts to vary with exchange-rate or price 
fluctuations, for example. The internal measurem ent of embedded derivatives is performed using 
appropriate valuation models, such as discounted cash flow models, which are based on unobservable 
inputs (Fair Value Level 3). The relevant models incl ude planned sales and purchase volumes, and prices 
derived from market data. Fair value changes over th e contract term are recognized in other operating 
income or expenses. 
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 153
Derivatives are recognized at fair value through profit or loss unless they qualif y for hedge accounting. This 
mainly applies to the exchange hedging of accountin g risks, the effects of which are reflected in other 
financial income and expenses as exchange gains or losses.  
The effective portion of derivatives desi gnated as cash flow hedges is init ially recognized outside profit or 
loss in other comprehensive income. An y ineffective portions are r ecognized directly in profit or loss. Only 
when the hedged item is recognized through profit or  loss is the effective portion of the hedging instrument 
also recognized in the income statement. 
In the case of commodity futures and options that hedge purchase prices, reclassification is to the cost of 
goods sold. For commodity futures that hedge selling pr ices, reclassification is to sales. The effects of 
interest-rate hedges are reflected in interest income  or expense. The effects of the hedging of forecasted 
sales transactions in foreign currencies are recognized in other operating income or expenses at the time 
of revenue recognition. The hedging of stock-based employee compensation is recognized in the respective operating expense items of “Enabling Functi ons and Consolidation” over the duration of the 
Aspire programs. 
Changes in the fair values of deriva tives designated as fair value hedges  are recognized in income along 
with the adjustments in the carryin g amounts of the hedged items. The effects of interest-rate hedges are 
reflected in interest income or expense. 
Acquisition accounting  
An acquisition is a transaction or other event that involves the purchase of an integrated set of activities 
and assets that include, at a minimum, an input an d a substantive process that together significantly 
contribute to the ability to  create outputs. Acquired businesses ar e accounted for using the acquisition 
method, which in principle requires that the assets acquired and liabilit ies assumed be recorded at their 
respective fair values on the date Bayer obtain s control. The difference be tween the consideration 
transferred (plus the fair value of th e pre-existing equity interest in  the acquiree in the case of step 
acquisitions) and the fair values of the acquired assets  and assumed liabilities is recognized as goodwill. 
The results of foreign currency cas h flow hedges are factored into the translation of foreign currency 
purchase price payments. For signif icant acquisitions, the purchase pr ice allocation is carried out with 
assistance from independent third-pa rty valuation specialists. The rela ted valuations are based on the 
information available at the acquisition date. Ancillary acquisition costs are recogn ized as expenses in the 
periods in which they occur.  
The transferred consideration can incl ude contingent consideration that is payable to the previous owners 
of the acquired company following the acquisition date upon reachin g certain milestones, such as 
progress in the trial or regulatory approval process or surpassing certain sales thresholds. This is recognized at fair value as part of the consideration transferred for the acquired  company and is generally 
recognized as a financial (purchase price) liability. All changes in fair value after the acquisition date are 
recognized under EBIT in the conso lidated financial statements. However, changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration th at are based on circumstances already ex isting on the date of acquisition are 
adjusted outside profit or loss within the measurement period of 12 months. 
The application of the acquisition method requires  certain estimates and assumptions to be made, 
especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and 
the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment. Measurement is based to  a large extent on anticipated cash flows. If actual 
cash flows vary from those used in  calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group’s future 
results of operations. In particular, the estimation of discounted cash flows from intangible assets under development, patented and nonpaten ted technologies, customer relati onships and brands is based on 
assumptions concerning, for example: 
// The outcomes of R&D activities rega rding the efficacy of a crop protectio n product, trait, seed or drug 
development candidate, and re sults of clinical trials 
// The probability of obtainin g regulatory approvals in  individual countries 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 154
// Long-term sales projections   
// Possible selling price erosion due to offerings of unp atented products following patent expirations 
// The behavior of competitors (launch of comp eting products, marketing initiatives, etc.) 
If the assets acquired do not constitute a business,  the individually identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed are recognized. The acquisition costs are allocated to the individual assets and liabilities 
at the acquisition date based on thei r fair values. Such a transaction or event does not result in goodwill. 
This also applies if the optional con centration test finds that the transact ion in question does not constitute 
the acquisition of a business. 
Divestment accounting 
Divestments of shares in subsidiaries that result in a loss of control are generally accounted for in profit or 
loss. When shares in a subsidiary are gradually divested in several tr anches, a reduction in the majority 
shareholding without the loss of cont rol is reflected outside profit or lo ss and results in an increase in the 
equity attributable to noncontrolling interest. After the lo ss of control, the interest remaining at the time of 
the loss of control is recognized at fair value. 
Impact of the macroeconomic situation 
In 2023, Bayer was impacted particularly by the geop olitical situation, inflat ion and the development of 
interest rates.  
The Group’s sales and earnings as well as its financia l position and results of operations were only 
marginally impacted by the war in  Ukraine and its direct consequen ces in 2023. Together, Russia and 
Ukraine accounted for about 3% of our sales in 2023. As in the previous year, we did not register any 
major increase in past-due receivables in Russia or Uk raine. Based on a risk analysis conducted at the 
level of individual customers, there were no significant write- downs of receivables. 
The stability of international paym ent transactions involving Russia is still subject to  considerable 
uncertainties, and we are continually evaluating suitable risk mitigation  measures. There are currently no 
significant restrictions. 
We are continually analyzing the future direct and in direct effects of economic developments and sanctions 
on the valuation of individual assets and liabilities. 
The conflict in the Middle East did not have a material  impact on Group sales an d earnings, the financial 
position or the results of operations in 2023. 
Energy procurement costs rose by around 8.7% (€74 million) year on year in 2023. The developments 
pertaining to LNG procurement, the further developm ent of energy-efficiency measures, the filling of gas 
storage facilities in Germany and the easing of the situ ation on the gas markets cu rrently mean that supply 
chains and our production are not impeded. We neve rtheless continue to monitor both global-market and 
political developments.  
Inflation and the associated rise in interest rates had an impact on the impairment testing of our intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment (see Note [14]), the measurement of pension provisions (see 
Note [22]) and other long-term obligations, as well as financial instruments (see Note [27]). 
Beyond this, we did not see any material financial impact in 2023.

Impact of climate-related matters 
Climate change can give rise to es timation uncertainties and risks with respect to accounting and the 
possible effects on Bayer’s financial posi tion and results of operations.  
Due to their potential impact on our financial position  and results of operations, climate-related risks are 
included in our Group-wide enterpri se risk management (ERM) system. In addition, we are conducting a 
continuous analysis of th e impact of climate change on our busi ness operations as well as activities in 
upstream and downstream value chai ns. The dimensions of climate-change impact analyzed include both 
drivers of transition effects as well as drivers of imme diate and long-term physical  effects. Physical climate-
related risks can arise as a result of longer-term sh ifts in general climate conditions, while transition 
climate-related risks may result for companies fr om the transition toward  a low-carbon economy.  
The climate models we have analyzed project that, over  the long term, there will be an increase in extreme 
weather conditions (such as droughts, heavy rains and storms) in terms of frequency and intensity, as well 
as a shift in climate zones. Potential financial cons equences resulting for our sites due to climate-related 
natural events are hedged through insurance coverage to the extent  customary in the industry. One 
example of a climate-related natural event was Hurricane Ida in 2021, which caused production 
disruptions that year at our site s in Soda Springs and Luling, Unit ed States. We therefore received 
insurance compensation of €195 million in 2023 as a result of our property and business interruption 
insurance coverage (see Note [7]). 
In 2023, climate-related matters did not necessitate any changes to the expected useful lives of Group 
assets, such as due to changing re gulatory requirements or climate-related natural events. Likewise, 
physical or transition-related climate risks did not l ead to any significant depreci ation or amortization. We 
are committed to continuously developing  our portfolio of assets by invest ing in sustainable technologies in 
order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
The shift in climate zones also presents an elevated ri sk of crop losses and thus risks for the agricultural 
value chain as a whole. Weather and climate effects ar e of particular significance for the Crop Science 
Division and its downstream value ch ain in crop cultivation. We are working to advance climate change 
adaptation while also aiming to counteract changing environmental conditions through innovation and new 
approaches in order to help streng then climate resilience. The objectiv e is to offer solutions that put our 
customers, patients and consumers in a bette r position to overcome the challenges.  
Transforming our product portfolio an d leveraging new business models is therefore one of the three pillars 
of our greenhouse gas reduction program (see Manageme nt Report A 1.2.1 “Strategy and Targets”). Our 
efforts to support climate change adap tation can be seen in our innovati ve plant breeding activities, for 
example. Our Preceon™ Smart Corn Sy stem, for instance, produces hybrid  seed varieties that grow into 
short-stature corn crops that potentially do not bend or break as easily as standa rd-height corn in strong 
winds or heavy rain, thus minimizing crop losses. Our Preceon™ Smart Corn System  is set to be launched 
for the first time in 2024 and is included in our product innovation pipeline (see Management Report A 1.3 “Focus on Innovation”). Our business planning takes account of research and development expenses for 
product innovations that can help adapt our business model to the impact of climate change. 
The other two pillars of our greenhouse gas reduct ion program concern the continual reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions at our comp any and across our entire value ch ain to help limit global warming 
to 1.5° Celsius in accordance with the UN Sustainabl e Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. As 
part of our greenhouse gas reduction program, we ai m to reach net zero emission s, including throughout 
our entire value chain, by 2050 or earlier. We d efine net zero greenhouse gas emissions as a 90% 
reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) and across our value 
chain (Scope 3) compared with the 2019 baseline. 
Bayer is looking to become carbon-neutral at all of its sites (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030. By the end of 2029, 
we aim to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations by 42% (in absolute terms) 
compared with the 2019 baseline. This includes direct  (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2, market-based) 
emissions produced by Bayer sites with an annual ener gy consumption in excess of 1.5 terajoules. We will 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 156
offset all of the remaining greenhouse gas emissions from our own operational processes by purchasing 
certificates from verified climate protection proj ects, primarily in forest ry and agriculture.  
With respect to our value chain, our target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the relevant Scope 3 
categories by at least 12.3% (in absolute terms) by 2029 (compared with the 2019 baseline). In line with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), the Scope 3 categories in the GHG Protocol “Corporate Value 
Chain (Scope 3) Accounting & Repo rting Standard” that are relevant for Bayer are as follows: (3.1) 
purchased goods and services, (3.2) capital goods, (3.3) fuel- and energy-related activities, (3.4) 
(upstream) transportation and distribution, and (3.6 ) business travel. Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
cover all categories defined in the GHG Protocol. 
An important lever for achieving our climate targets is the purchase of electricity from renewable sources. 
By 2029, we aim to ensure 100% of the electricity we procure is from renewa ble energy sources. We 
therefore conclude direct supply ag reements for electricity from rene wable energy sources or purchase 
corresponding renewable energy cr edits. In May 2023, we announced the signing of a long-term 
structured renewable energy credit (REC) purchase agreement in the United States under which up to 
1.4 TWh of renewable energy will be generated a nnually and accordingly up to 1.4 million RECs can be 
acquired by us annually. The agreement will secure 40% of Bayer’s global and 60% of Bayer’s US-
purchased electricity demand out of renewable sour ces. The contract is designed as a contract of 
difference between fixed strike prices and energy prices . Full capacity is currently expected to be reached 
during 2028. The agreement has an  expected initial term of 24 years during which RECs can be 
purchased. As operations of the facilities have not yet started, no RECs were pu rchased in 2023. The first 
RECs are expected to be generated, purchase d and retired in 2024 (for further information,
 see Note [27]). 
In addition, we actively participate in the voluntary carbon market, wher e we both purchase carbon offsets 
from verified climate protection projects as well as pr ovide our own carbon offsets.  In 2023, we offset 0.6 
million metric tons of CO 2 equivalents via external projects to ach ieve climate neutrality at our sites. 
Besides the voluntary carbon market, we also partic ipate in mandatory emissions trading. For further 
information on how carbon cr edits and offsets are account ed for, see Note [3]. 
The Crop Science Division’s medium-term planning co ntains climate-related in vestments in connection 
with the implementation of the greenhouse gas redu ction program that are al so taken into account in 
impairment testing. Since the risks and opportunities  from the impact of climate change are balanced, 
there is currently no need to revise the long-term gr owth rate. Based on currently available information, 
there are no indications that additi onal impairment losses will be requ ired over and above the impairment 
losses already recognized  (see Note [14]).  
We continuously monitor the risks resulting from climate-related matters and develop innovative and 
sustainable methods to minimize them. Based on present information and assumptions, we do not currently see any fundamentally chan ged expectations with regard to the Group’s financial position and 
results of operations.

4. Segment reporting 
At Bayer, the Board of Management – as the chief operating decision maker – allocates resources to the 
operating segments and assesses thei r performance. The reportable segm ents and regions are identified, 
and the disclosures selected, in lin e with the internal financial repo rting system (management approach) 
and based on the Group accounting policies outlined in Note [3]. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Bayer Group comprise d the three reportable segments Crop Science, 
Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health . Their activities are as follows: 
B 4/1 
Activities of the Segments 
Segment Activities 
Crop Science Development, production and marketing of a br oad portfolio of products in seeds and plant traits, crop 
protection, digital solutions and customer se rvices to promote sustainable agriculture 
Pharmaceuticals Development, production an d marketing of prescription products, especially for cardiology and women’s 
health; specialty therapeutics in the areas of onco logy, hematology, ophthalmology and – in the medium 
term – cell and gene therapy; diagnostic imaging  equipment and the necessary contrast agents 
Consumer Health Development, production and marketing of ma inly nonprescription (OTC = o ver-the-counter) products in 
the dermatology, nutritional suppl ements, digestive health, allergy, cough and cold, and pain and 
cardiovascular risk prevention categories 
  
 
Information on other business activities and segments that are not reportable is provided under “All Other 
Segments.” These include Bayer 04 Leverkusen  Fussball GmbH and Bayer Gastronomie GmbH.  
The information provided under “Enabling Functions and Consolidation” mainly relates to Group-wide 
competence centers and business supp ort services as well as “Leaps by Bayer,” which focuses on the 
development of crucial, cross-species innovations. “All Other Segments” and “Enabling Functions and Consolidation” in the Management Report are combined under the Reco nciliation. It also includes the 
increase or decrease in expenses fo r Group-wide long-term stock-base d compensation (Aspire) arising 
from fluctuations in the performance of Bayer stock and other factors, and the consolidation of 
intersegment sales (2023: €57 millio n; 2022: €22 million). Also recogniz ed are gains and losses incurred 
upon the ongoing revaluation of nonmonetary assets and liabilities and of equity under IAS 29 for Bayer 
S.A. in Argentina and for Bayer Türk Kimya Sanayii Limited Sirketi, Monsanto Gida Ve Tarim Ticaret Ltd Sirketi and Bayer Tohumculuk ve Tarim Limited Sirketi in  Turkey. Included here in addition are income and 
expenses resulting from certain co ntingent liabilities unrelated to the current business al ong with those 
pertaining to the comparab le central functions of the acquired Mons anto Group. Chief among the latter are 
the matters relating to lawsuits concerning polychlo rinated biphenyls (PCBs) refer red to in Note [30],  
“Legal risks”. 
The segment data is calculated as follows:   
// The intersegment sales reflect intr a-Group transactions effected at tr ansfer prices fixed on an arm’s-
length basis.  
// The net cash provided by operating activities is th e cash flow from operating activities as defined in 
IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows). 
// Leases between fully consolidated companies continue to be recogn ized as operating leases under 
IAS 17 within the segment data in the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group even after 
the first-time application of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019. This does not have any relevant impact on the respective key data used in the steering of the company and internal reporting to the Board of Management as the chief operating decision maker.

1 Acquisitions, newly established companies and acquisition of control 
In conjunction with the acquisition of the consumer  care business of Merck & Co., Inc., United States, 
Bayer entered into a strategic collaboration with that company in 2014. This collaboration is included in the consolidated financial statements as  a joint operation. Bayer and Merck & Co., Inc., have mutually agreed 
to collaborate on the development, production, life-cycle management and marketing of active ingredients and products in the field of solubl e guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation. 
In addition, shares in 42 (2022: 43 ) associates and four (2022: five) joint ventures were accounted for in 
the consolidated financial statemen ts using the equity method. Details of these companies are given in 
Note [16]. 
A total of 54 (2022: 67) subsidiaries, including one (2022: one) structured entity and nine (2022: 10) 
associates or joint ventures that in aggregate are immaterial to the Bayer Group’s financial position and 
results of operations are neithe r consolidated nor accounted for us ing the equity method, but are 
recognized at fair value. The immaterial subsidiaries accounted for less than 0. 1% of Group sales, less 
than 0.3% of equity and less than 0.2% of total assets.
 
Details of the companies included in the consolidat ed financial statements, the subsidiary and affiliated 
companies of the Bayer Group pursuant to Section 313, Paragraph 2 of the German Commercial Code, 
and a list of domestic subsidiaries that availed them selves in 2023 of certain exemptions granted under 
Section 264, Paragraph 3, and Section 264b of the German Commercial Code, are included in the audited 
consolidated financial statements that have been sent for entry into the Company Registry. This 
information can also be accessed at www.bayer.com/shareownership2023. 
5.2 Business combinations and other acquisitions 
Acquisitions in 2023 On February 13, 2023, we completed the acquisition of  100% of the shares in Blackford Analysis Ltd., 
United Kingdom, a global provider of radiology AI pl atform technology. Bayer paid  an upfront consideration 
of around €46 million to acquire Blackford. Further am ounts of up to around €54 million are payable upon 
the achievement of predefined research and developm ent milestones. A liability of €30 million, weighted 
according to the probability that the payments will have  to be made, was recognized for this purpose. The 
purchase price mainly pertained to goodwill, which in  turn largely reflected th e anticipated innovation 
potential and amounted to around €68 million based on  the purchase price allocation. In addition, an 
amount of around €10 million was recognized for pa tents and technologies, so me €2 million for other 
assets, and approximately €7 million for liabilities. Th e purchase price allocation was completed in the 
fourth quarter of 2023.  
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 162
Blackford provides platform infrastructure and access to a rich clinical appli cation (ClinApp) ecosystem 
focused on medical imaging and an alytics. The acquisition follows a development and license agreement 
between the two companies in 2020 that laid the found ation for Bayer’s recently launched medical imaging 
platform, Calantic™ Digital Solu tions. The acquired companies ar e assigned to the Pharmaceuticals 
segment.  
Acquisitions in 2022 
On June 28, 2022, Bayer acquired 30% of the shares in Natsana GmbH, Germany, for a purchase price of 
around €96 million. The acquired shar es are accounted for using the equi ty method. Natsana is an online-
only provider focused on the sale  and development of natural supplem ents such as vitamins, minerals, 
nutrients and probiotics. Its portfo lio comprises over 100 products under its three main brands: Feel 
Natural, Nature Love and Natural Elements. Bayer will acquire the other 70% of sh ares in 2025 based on a 
buyout mechanism agreed to when closing the transaction. The comp any is assigned to the Consumer 
Health segment. 
On August 1, 2022, Bayer increased its existing interest in CoverCress Inc., United States, from 5.7% to 
64.7% for a purchase price of around €111 million. Since the minority shareh olders Bunge and Chevron 
retained extensive rights relevant to business decisions,  the acquired interest is recognized as an interest 
in an associate and accounted for usin g the equity method. In addition, there is an option to acquire the 
remaining 35.3%, which is anticipated to become availa ble from 2027. CoverCress™ is a rotational cash 
crop which combines grain production with the environmental benefits of a cover crop without displacing other harvests. Oil extracted from CoverCress™ grain is designed to achieve a lower carbon intensity 
score. The company is assigned  to the Crop Science segment. 
5.3 Discontinued operations, assets and liabilities held for sale, 
and divestments  
Discontinued operations 
There were no discontinued operations to report in 2023 or 2022. 
Assets and liabilities held for sale 
The assets held for sale, net of directly related lia bilities, totaled around € 51 million as of December 31, 
2023 (December 31, 2022: €3 million). They primarily pertained to the planned sale of administration 
buildings and the related land and property in Spai n for approximately €36 million, and of a production 
facility of the Crop Science Division, al so in Spain, for around €11 million. 
Divestments 
There were no significant divestments in 2023. 
Divestments in 2022 
On October 4, 2022, Bayer completed the sale and transfer of the Crop Science Division’s Environmental Science Professional business to the private equity firm Cinven, United Kingdom. Environmental Science 
Professional is a global leader offering solutions to  control pests, disease and weeds in nonagricultural 
areas such as vector control, pro fessional pest management, vegetation management, forestry, and turf 
and ornamentals. The transaction was completed on October 4, 2022. The purchase price paid for the 
business amounted to approximately €2,299 million before customary pu rchase price adjustments. The 
divestment gain of €785 million was re cognized in other operating income.

6. Net sales 
Total reported net sales in 2023 fell by €3,102 millio n, or 6.1%, year on year to €47,637 million. Sales 
were derived primarily from product deliveries (€43,352 million; 2022: €46 ,412 million) and licenses 
(€3,528 million; 2022: €3,504 million). The licen se revenues amounted to €2,721 million (2022: 
€2,571 million) for Crop Science,  €806 million (2022: €930 million)  for Pharmaceuticals and €1 million 
(2022: €3 million) for Consumer Health. Breakdowns of net sales by segment and geographical area are 
given in the overview in Note [4].  
Sales of €2,026 million were recognized in 2023 (2 022: €1,960 million) from performance obligations 
already satisfied in previous years. These sales primar ily resulted from right-to- use licenses granted against 
sales-based royalties and from adjustments to refund lia bilities for expected prod uct returns and rebates to 
be granted.  
Contractually agreed sales volumes pertaining to performance obligations not yet satisfied as of 
December 31, 2023, are expected to be reclassified  to profit or loss as follows, taking into account 
anticipated sales deductions:

The description above only accounts fo r customer contracts with an origin al contractual term of more than 
one year. 
Contract liabilities mainly result from advance pa yments by customers for product deliveries and are 
predominantly recognized as  sales within one year. Further signif icant amounts of contract liabilities 
comprised milestone payments alread y received for right-to-access license s. The contract liabilities under 
right-to-access licenses will be reco gnized as sales over a period of more than five years.

9. Personnel expenses and employee numbers 
Personnel expenses decreased by  €1,928 million in 2023 to €10,691 million (2022: €12,619 million).

Notes to the Income Statements 169
The net asset surplus arising from deferred tax recei vables and liabilities dec lined year on year by 
€197 million. Of this amount, €78 milli on was recognized as deferred tax expense in the income statement 
and €119 million mainly as a reduction in other co mprehensive income and as expenses relating to 
ongoing hyperinflation. The change in other comprehensive income mainly relates to the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability fo r post-employment benefit plans. 
The use of tax loss carryforwards reduced current  income taxes in 2023 by €20 million (2022: 
€422 million). The use of tax credits reduced current  income taxes by €50 m illion (2022: € 283 million). 
Of the total tax loss and interest carryforwards of €18,511 million, including interest carryforwards of 
€1,978 million (2022: €15,924 million, including interest  carryforwards of €1,037 million), an amount of 
€5,080 million, including interest car ryforwards of €44 million (2022: €3,727 million, including interest 
carryforwards of €81 million) is  expected to be usable within a reasonable period.  
Deferred tax assets of €713 million (2022: €524 million)  were recognized for the amount of tax loss and 
interest carryforwards expected to be usable. Th e use of €13,431 million of  tax loss and interest 
carryforwards, including interest carryforwards of €1, 934 million (2022: €12,196 million, in cluding interest 
carryforwards of €956 million) was su bject to legal or economic restrict ions. Consequently , no deferred tax 
assets were recognized for this amount. The addition of usable tax loss and interest carryforwards mainly 
resulted from the measurement of loss  carryforwards in the Un ited States at the state level. If these tax 
loss and interest carryforwards had been fully us able, deferred tax assets of €1,410 million (2022:

Tax credits of €635 million (2022: €1,029 million) were  recognized as deferred tax assets in 2023.  
The use of €878 million (2022: €165 million) of tax credits was subject  to legal or economic restrictions. 
Consequently, no deferred tax assets were recognized for this amount.

The use of €1,045 million (2022: €3 ,513 million) of deductible tempor ary differences was subject to legal 
or economic restrictions. Consequently, no deferred tax assets were recognized for this amount. The 
decline is mainly due to a remeasurement of the dedu ctible temporary differences  in connection with the 
settlement agreements in the United  States. If these temporary differen ces had been fully usable, deferred 
tax assets of €256 million (2022: €857 million) would have been recognized.  
In 2023, subsidiaries that reported losses for 2023 or 2022 recognized net deferred tax assets totaling 
€1,922 million (2022: €2,720 million) from temporary di fferences, tax credits, an d tax loss and interest 
carryforwards. These assets were considered to be  unimpaired because the companies concerned were 
expected to generate taxable income in the future  or sufficiently taxable temporary differences. 
Deferred tax liabilities of €106 million were recognized  in 2023 (2022: €92 millio n) for planned dividend 
payments by subsidiaries. Deferred tax liabilities we re not recognized for di fferences on €14,612 million 
(2022: €23,838 million) of retained earnings of subsidiaries because these earnings are to be reinvested 
for an indefinite period.

1 Expected income tax (income) and expense is calculated by applying an expected weighted average tax rate to the pre-tax income  of the 
Group. This average rate was determined on the basis of expected tax rates for the individual Group companies. 
The reduction in the expected tax expense year on year was largely due to the fact that tax income is 
expected due to the pre-tax loss and that the weighted, expected tax rate for countries with income led to 
additional tax relief and a higher expected tax rate. 
The increase in taxes due to non-tax-deductible expe nses related to the operating business amounted to 
€351 million and was mainly the result of payments in  connection with the settlement agreements reached 
in the United States as well as due to the increase in  trade-tax additions and non-tax-deductible operating 
expenses in connection with dividends in Germany. 
Tax expense for expected unrecoverable temporary di fferences, tax loss and interest carryforwards of 
€495 million primarily pertained to an im pairment loss for previously rec ognized deferred tax assets arising 
from temporary differences, tax credits, and loss an d interest carryforwards in connection with the 
settlement agreements in the United States. 
The €1,314 million in tax expenses from other ta x effects primarily comprised effects of €1,671 million due 
to non-tax-deductible impairment lo sses on goodwill. This line item also  included tax benefits from the 
utilization and initial a llocation of tax credits, from an extended deduction of charitable donations and tax-
deductible indirect taxes, as well as tax expenses from tax provisions estab lished for controlled foreign 
corporation taxation. 
The Bayer Group falls within  the scope of the global minimum taxati on rules (“Pillar Two”), which entered 
into force in Germany on December 28, 2023, in the form of the Minimum Tax Act (MinStG). As the Minimum Tax Act applies for the first time for fiscal  years beginning after December 30, 2023, there was 
no minimum tax exposure for the fiscal year 2023. The implementation of the global minimum tax rules into domestic legislation in other jurisdictions also did not result in any minimum tax being levied in 2023. 
Under the Minimum Tax Act, the Ba yer Group must pay a top-up tax fo r each jurisdiction in which the 
effective tax rate is below 15%. During the transitional  period from 2024 until 2026, the top-up tax can, 
upon request, be deemed to be zero for a jurisdic tion where the requirements of the Country-by-Country 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Income Statements 171
Reporting Safe Harbour rules are met. Bayer will exer cise this option, which, based on the 2023 fiscal 
year, would lead to the company being exempt from minimum taxation in 83% of jurisdictions. 
Given the complexity of the minimum taxation rule s, the still pending implementation into domestic 
legislation in many jurisdictions, and the Bayer Group’ s business performance in the next years, it is not 
yet possible to reliably assess the quantitative effects arising from the global implementation of the 
minimum taxation rules for 2024. The top-up tax is expe cted to be in the double-d igit millions and thus not 
material for the Bayer Group compared with the tax expense of €1,321 million in 2023. In order to 
preliminarily identify jurisdictions with an effective tax rate below 15%, the reported IFRS earnings before 
taxes and consolidation effects were adjusted for divi dend income and goodwill impairments attributable to 
acquisitions of enterprises. Jurisdic tions in which a pre-tax loss was repo rted after these adjustments were 
not included in the identification process. If the P illar Two rules had already been applicable in the 2023 
reporting period, Switzerland, Cyprus and Brazil in particular would have contributed to a top-up tax. 
12. Income  / losses attributable to noncontrolling interest 
Income attributable to noncontr olling interest amounted to €6 million (2022: €19 million). Losses 
attributable to noncontrolling intere st amounted to €7 m illion (2022: €3 million). The income and losses 
primarily pertained to Bayer LLC Saudia Arabia, Sa udi Arabia (income of €3 million, 2022: loss of 
€1 million), Rede Agro Fidelidade e Intermediacao S. A., Brazil (income of €3 million, 2022: income of 
€2 million), and Bayer CropScience Limited, India (l oss of €5 million, 2022: income of €18 million). 
13. Earnings per share  
Earnings per share are determined according to IAS 33 (E arnings Per Share) by dividing the net income for 
the period attributable to Bayer AG stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares. As no dilutive financial instruments were in circulation at the end of the 2022 and 2023 reporting periods, diluted earnings per share were equiva lent to basic earnings per share.

The amortization of intangible assets is allocated to  the individual functional costs on the basis of the 
economic substance of the underlying asset. The am ortization of trademarks and of marketing and 
distribution rights is generally reflected in selling expe nses, and the amortization of  production rights in the 
cost of goods sold. The amortization of patents and t echnologies is mainly includ ed in the cost of goods 
sold or in research and development expenses. Acqu ired goodwill, research and development projects, 
and advance payments made are not subject to amortization. 
Unscheduled impairment testing was conducted in the first quarter of 2023 for the Crop Science 
segment’s cash-generating unit glyphosate after a weak  start to 2023 led to revised full-year expectations, 
mainly due to significantly reduced  market price expectations for glyphosate. In addition, lower 
expectations for volumes also had an impact. Impairment testing gave rise to impairment losses of 
approximately €278 million, attributable entirely to property, plant and equipmen t. The impairment losses 
were allocated to the cost of goods sold, with the resp ective figures determined on the basis of fair value 
less costs of disposal while applying an aft er-tax cost of capital rate of 11.5%. 
Impairment testing was conducted in the second quarter of 2023 in the Crop Science segment due to a 
further deterioration in business prospects and updated long-term corporate planning. 
In the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health segmen ts, updated long-term corporate planning did not 
necessitate impairment testing. 
The unscheduled impairment testing in the Crop Scie nce segment resulted in net impairment losses on 
intangible assets totaling €2,020 million. An impair ment loss of €2,436 million was recognized on goodwill 
due to deteriorating business prospects overall, largely driven by significantly lower price expectations for 
glyphosate. 
The impairment testing resulted in th e recognition of impairment loss re versals in the cash-generating units 
Soybean Seed & Traits (€1,253 millio n, comprising €140 million on re search and development projects, 
€971 million on patents and technologies, €114 million on trademarks and €28 million on marketing and 
distribution rights) and Vegeta ble Seeds (€134 million, comprisi ng €37 million on research and 
development projects, €81 million on  patents and technologies, €13 m illion on trademarks and €3 million 
on marketing and distribution rights). The impairment  loss reversal for Soybean Seed & Traits was largely 
due to reduced expectations for the cost of goods sold as a result  of lower commodity prices. The 
impairment loss reversal for Vege table Seeds was due to improved business prospects as a result of 
increased market penetration and growing market share in Asia. 
In contrast, impairment losses were recognized in the cash-generating units Corn Seed & Traits 
(€579 million, comprising €99  million on research and development pr ojects, €376 million on patents and 
technologies, €89 million on trademarks and €15 million on  marketing and distribution  rights), Cotton Seed 
(€392 million, comprising €22 million on research and developmen t projects, €330 million on patents 
and technologies, and €40 million on trademarks), an d glyphosate (€277 million,  comprising €277 million 
on property, plant and equipment). Th e impairment loss at Corn Seed & Traits was mainly driven by the 
anticipated long-term normalization of commodity pr ices. The impairment loss for Cotton Seed was 
primarily attributable to persistent competitive pres sure. The impairment loss for glyphosate was mainly 
due to significant further declines in market price expectations. In addition, further reductions in 
expectations with regard to volumes also had an impact. 
The impairment losses on goodwill were recognized in other operating expenses. The impairment losses 
and impairment loss reversals on the assets of the cash-generating units were allocated to the cost of 
goods sold, selling expenses, and research and de velopment expenses. The impairment losses and 
impairment loss reversals reflected the difference be tween the respective carrying amounts and their fair 
value less costs of disposal. 
Impairment testing was conducted in the third quarter of 2023 due to interest-rate developments at that 
time and their related impact on th e weighted average cost of capital. 
The impairment testing did not give rise to any materi al impairment losses or impairment loss reversals in 
the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health segments.

Within the Crop Science segment, it resulted in the recognition of net impairme nt losses of €3,951 million 
on intangible assets, of which €3,6 21 million on goodwill, in the third qu arter of 2023. In addition, there 
were impairment losses in the cash-generating unit Soybean Seed & Traits (€ 330 million, comprising 
€38 million on research and develo pment projects, €255 million on pa tents and technologies, €30 million 
on trademarks and €7 million on mark eting and distribution rights). The impairment losses on goodwill 
were recognized in other operating expenses and those on the assets of the cash-generating units were 
allocated to the cost of goods so ld, selling expenses, and research and development expenses. The 
impairment losses were primarily at tributable to an increase in the weig hted average cost of capital and 
reflected the difference between the respective carrying am ounts and their fair value less costs of disposal. 
Our regular annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in the recognition of net 
impairment loss reversals of €562 million on intangible assets in the Crop Science segment. This included 
€633 million in impairment losses on go odwill, which were primarily the resu lt of a deterioration in business 
prospects, particularly in the area of  crop protection, and an inflation-dr iven increase in costs. This effect 
was offset by a decrease in the weig hted average cost of capital comp ared to the third quarter of 2023. 
Impairment loss reversals arose at the cash-genera ting units Corn Seed & Traits (€1,130 million, 
comprising €202 million on research and development projects, €721 million on pa tents and technologies, 
€176 million on trademarks and €31 million on marketing and distributi on rights) and Soybean Seed & 
Traits (€65 million, compri sing €8 million on research and develo pment projects, €50 million on patents 
and technologies, €6 million on trademarks and €1 millio n on marketing and distri bution rights). These 
impairment loss reversals were mainly attributable to a decrease in the weighted  average cost of capital 
compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
The impairment losses on goodwill were recognized in other operating expenses. The impairment losses 
and loss reversals on the assets of the cash-generating  units were included in the cost of goods sold, 
selling costs, and research and development expe nses. The impairment losses and impairment loss 
reversals reflected the difference betw een the respective carrying amounts and their fair value less costs of 
disposal. 
The table below indicates the capital cost factors used in the impairment testing on the cash-generating 
units of the Crop Science segment in the fourth quarte r of 2022, and the second, third and fourth quarters 
of 2023.

Our regular annual impairment testing in the fourth quar ter gave rise to impairment losses of €54 million in 
the Pharmaceuticals segment, particularly due to ex tended development cycles in ongoing projects 
(comprising €26 million on patents, €18 million on re search and development projects, and €10 million on 
trademarks). In addition, impairment losses of €7 6 million were recognized in  2023 – on top of those 
recorded in the fourth quarter – due to the ongoing evaluation of individual research and development 
projects during the year. The impairment losses we re allocated to selling expenses, and research and 
development expenses. 
In the Consumer Health segment, regular annual impair ment testing resulted in impairment loss reversals 
totaling €153 million on trademarks, of which €116 million pertained to th e Claritin™ (allergy business) and 
€37 million to Afrin™ (cough and co ld business). These were mainly the result of a decrease in the 
weighted average cost of capital compared to the th ird quarter of 2023. The we ighted average cost of 
capital in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 6.2% (Q3 2023: 6.7%) for Claritin™ and 6.6% (Q3 2023: 7.2%) 
for Afrin™. The impairment losses were recognized in the selling expenses.

The long-term growth rates and cost of capital factors used in the impa irment testing of goodwill in the 
fourth quarter of 2022, third quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2023 are shown in the following table. A long-term growth rate of 2% and an  after-tax cost of capital of 10.1 % were applied in the testing of 
goodwill for impairment in the Crop Scien ce segment in the second quarter of 2023.

Testing goodwill for impairment involv es calculating the fair value less co sts to sell. Impairment losses of 
€734 million were recognized on goodwill in the Crop Sc ience segment in 2022.  
A sensitivity analysis undertaken for the impairme nt testing of goodwill in  the Pharmaceuticals and 
Consumer Health segments at year-end was based on a 10% reduction in future cash flows, a 10% 
increase in the weighted average co st of capital or a one-percentage -point reduction in the long-term 
growth rate. As in the prior year, the sensitivity analys is showed that no impairment loss would need to be 
recognized for the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Heal th segments in the event of a 10% reduction in 
future cash flows, a 10% increase in  the weighted average cost of cap ital, or a one-percentage-point 
reduction in the long-term growth rate. At the Crop Science segment, a 10% redu ction in future cash flows 
would lead to an impairment loss of approximately €3.9 billion, a 10% increase in the weighted average 
cost of capital to an impairment loss of approximately €4.3 billion, and a one-per centage-point reduction in 
the long-term growth rate to an im pairment loss of approximately €3.3 billion, each of which would have 
led to an additional impairment loss on goodwill. The pr ior-year analysis showed that it would have been 
necessary to recognize impairment lo sses of approximately €4.6 billion if future cash flows decreased by 
10%, of approximately €5.1 billion if the weighted av erage cost of capital increased by 10%, and of 
approximately €4.2 billion if the long-term growth  rate decreased by one percentage point. 
The following table shows the sensitivities of the cash-generating units of the Crop Science segment 
in relation to a 10% increase in th e weighted average cost of capital and a 10% reduction in future cash 
flows:

Research and development projects n ot yet available for use were incl uded in unamortized intangible 
assets at a total amount of €3,5 41 million as of the end of 2023 (2022: €3,764 million). In the case of 
research and development projects, the point in time from which a capitalized asset can be expected to 
generate an economic benefit for th e company cannot be determined. Such  assets are therefore classified 
as having an indefinite useful life and are subjected to annual impairment testing.  
Another unamortized intangible asset is the Bayer Cross, which was reacquired for the North America 
region in 1994, having been awarded to the United States and Canada under the reparations agreements 
at the end of the First World War.  The period for which the Bayer Group will derive an economic benefit 
from this name cannot be determined as Bayer intends to make continuous use of it. The Bayer Cross is capitalized at €108 millio n (2022: €108 million).

Trade accounts receivable mainly co mprise amounts outstanding from  diverse customer groups and 
distribution channels (including dealers and retaile rs for all units of the company, pharmacies for 
Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health, and farmers fo r Crop Science). These receivables expose the 
Bayer Group to a credit risk, though not to significant credit risk concentrations because the risk is spread 
among a large number of counterparties and customers. Receivables that were not individually impaired 
were classified as recoverable on the basis of established credit ma nagement processes and individual 
estimates of customer risks. The loss allowances recogn ized at the closing date contained appropriate risk 
provisions. 
Noncurrent trade accounts receivabl e comprised receivables of €80 million (2022: €124 million) in 
connection with rights to use technologies outlicensed to a customer that were acquired through the acquisition of Monsanto.

21. Equity 
The individual equity components and the changes therein during 2022  and 2023 are shown in the Bayer 
Group Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.  
Capital management 
The foremost objectives of our financial management are to maintain business operations long term, help 
bring about a sustained incr ease in Bayer’s value for the benefit of  all stakeholders and to ensure the 
Group’s creditworthiness and liquidity. The pursuit of  these goals means reducing our cost of capital, 
optimizing our capital structure,  improving our financing cash flow and effectively managing risk. 
The Group’s capital management is based on the de bt indicators used by the rating agencies. These 
indicators, which vary in their design, represent the ra tio of period earnings to debt. We have the ambition 
to reduce our financial debt considerably, to increas e profit and cash flow an d to improve our current 
investment grade ratings toward the “A” category. The contracted rating agencies assess Bayer as follows: S&P Global assigns a long-term rating of BBB and a sh ort-term rating of A-2 with a positive outlook, 
Moody’s a Baa2/P-2 with a negative outlook, and Fitc h Ratings a BBB+/F2 with a negative outlook. These 
investment grade ratings from all three agencies refl ect the company’s high solvency and ensure access to 
a broad investor base for financing purposes. 
In addition to utilizing cash inflo ws from our operational business to reduce net financial debt, we are 
implementing our financial strategy by way of vehicles  such as subordinated hy brid bonds and a potential 
share buyback program. Net financial debt comprises bo nds, liabilities to banks, lease liabilities, liabilities 
from derivative financial instrument s and other financial liabilities less r eceivables from derivative financial 
instruments, cash and cash equivalents as well as current financial assets. 
Bayer is not subject to any minimum capital requ irements from major financing measures at the 
Group level.  
Capital stock and capital reserves 
The capital stock of Bayer AG on December 31, 2023,  amounted to €2,515 millio n (2022: €2,515 million), 
divided into 982,424,082 (2022: 982,424,082) registered no-par shares, and was fully  paid in. Each no-par 
share confers one voting right.

Accumulated comprehensive income 
Accumulated comprehensive income comprises reta ined earnings and accumulated other comprehensive 
income. The retained earnings compri se prior years’ undistributed inco me of consolidated companies and 
all remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability for pension or other post-e mployment benefits that 
are recognized outside profit or loss. The accumulated other comprehe nsive income comprises exchange 
rate effects recognized outside profit or loss that arise from the translation of the annual financial 
statements of subsidiaries outside the eurozone, the changes in fair valu es of equity instruments and cash 
flow hedges.  
Dividend 
Under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the di vidend payment is determined by the distributable 
profit reported in the annual financial statements  of Bayer AG, which are prepared according to the 
German Commercial Code. Retained earnings were dimi nished by payment of the dividend of €2.40 per 
share for 2022. The proposed dividend for the 2023 fis cal year is €0.11 per share, which – based on the 
current number of shares – would result in a tota l dividend payment of €108 million. Payment of the 
proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by the stockholders at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting 
and therefore is not recognized as a liabilit y in the consolidated financial statements.

The benefit obligations pertained mainly to Germany (64%; 2022: 65%), the United States (19%; 2022: 
20%) and the United Kingdom (6%;  2022: 6%). In Germany, current  employees accounted for about 27% 
(2022: 29%), retirees or their surviving dependents for about 64% (2022: 62%) and former employees with vested pension rights for about 9% (2022: 9%) of entitlements under defined benefit plans. In the United States, current employees accounted for about 23% (2022: 24%), retirees or their surviving dependents 
for about 61% (2022: 60%) and former employees with vested pension rights for about 16% (2022: 16%) of entitlements under defined benefit plans. 
The actual gains on the assets of defined benefit plans for pensions and fo r other post-employment 
benefits amounted to €1,423 million (2022: lo ss of €3,650 million) and €40 million (2022: loss of 
€104 million), respectively.

Pension and other post-emplo yment benefit obligations 
Group companies provide retirement benefits for most of their employees, either directly or by contributing 
to privately or publicly administered funds. The benefi ts vary depending on the legal, fiscal and economic 
conditions of each country. A substantial part of the pension entitlements consists of defined contribution 
obligations, where the minimum benefit amount is based directly on the contribution level. The obligations relate both to existing retirees’ pensions an d to pension entitlements of future retirees. 
Bayer has set up funded pension plans for its empl oyees in various countries . The most appropriate 
investment strategy is determined for each defined ben efit pension plan based on the risk structure of the 
obligations (especially demographics, the current funded status, the stru cture of the expected future cash 
flows, interest sensitivity, biometri c risks, etc.), the regulatory enviro nment and the existing level of risk 
tolerance or risk capacity. A strategic target investment portfolio is then develope d in line with the plan’s 
risk structure, taking capital market  factors into consideration. Further de terminants are risk diversification, 
portfolio efficiency and the need fo r both a country-specific and a glob al risk/return profile centered on 
ensuring the payment of all future benefits. As the capital investment strategy for each pension plan is 
developed individually in light of the plan-specific conditions listed ab ove, the investment strategies for 
different pension plans may vary considerably. The inve stment strategies are generally aligned less toward 
maximizing absolute returns and mo re toward the maximum probability of being able to finance pension 
commitments over the long term. For pension plans,  stress scenarios are simulated and other risk 
analyses (such as value at risk) undertaken with the aid of risk management systems. 
Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG, Germany (Bayer-Pensions kasse), is one of the most significant post-
employment benefit plans. It has been closed to new members since 20 05. This legally independent fund 
is regarded as a life insurance company and therefore is subject to the German Insurance Supervision Act. 
The benefit obligations covered by Bayer-Pensionskasse comprise retirement, surviving dependents’ and 
disability pensions. It constitutes a defined-benefit, multi-employer plan, to which the active members and 
their employers contribute. The company contribution is a certain percentage of the employee 
contribution. This percentage is the same for all part icipating employers, including those outside the Bayer 
Group, and is set by agreement between the plan’s ex ecutive committee and its supervisory board, acting 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 192
on a proposal from the responsible actuary. It take s into account the differences between the actuarial 
estimates and the actual values for the factors used to determine liabilities and contributions. Bayer may 
also adjust the company contribution  in agreement with the plan’s execu tive committee and its supervisory 
board, acting on a proposal from th e responsible actuary. The plan’s lia bility is governed by Section 1, 
Paragraph 1, Sentence 3 of the German Law on the Improvement of Occupational Pensions (BetrAVG). This means that if the pension plan exercises its righ t under the articles of association to reduce benefits, 
each participating employer has to make up the result ing difference. Bayer is not liable for the obligations 
of participating employers outside the Bayer Group, even if they cease to participate in the plan.  
Pension entitlements for people who joined Bayer in German y in 2005 or later are granted via Rheinische 
Pensionskasse VVaG, Germany. Future pension payments from this defined-benefit, multi-employer plan 
are based on contributions and the re turn on plan assets; a guaranteed interest rate applies. All of the 
German Insurance Supervision Act regulations and BetrAVG provisions described in the section above on 
Bayer-Pensionskasse apply analogously to Rheinische Pensionskasse. 
Another important financing vehicle is Bayer Pension Trust e. V. (BPT), Germany. This covers further 
retirement provision arrangements of the Bayer Group, such as deferred compensation, pension 
obligations previously administered by Schering Altersversorgung Treuhand e. V., Germany, and 
components of other direct commitments. 
The defined benefit pension plans in the United States  are frozen and no significant new entitlements can 
be earned under these plans. The assets of all the US pension plans are held by a master trust for reasons 
of efficiency. The applicable regulatory framework is  based on the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act (ERISA), which includes a statutory 80% minimum funding requirement to avoid benefit restrictions. 
The actuarial risks, such as investme nt risk, interest-rate risk and longev ity risk, remain with the company.  
The defined benefit pension plans in the United Ki ngdom have been closed to new members for some 
years. Plan assets in the UK are administered by independent trustees , who are legally obligated to act 
solely in the interests of the beneficiaries. A techni cal assessment is performed every three years in line 
with UK regulations. This serves as the basis for developing a plan to cover any potential financing requirements. Here, too, the actuarial  risks remain with the company. 
The other post-employment benefit obligations outs ide Germany mainly comp rised healthcare benefit 
payments for retirees in the United States.

Plan assets included assets with a carrying amount  of €3,739 million (2022: €2,899 million) whose fair 
values are not determined based on quoted prices in active markets. 
The plan assets in Germany included real estate leas ed by Group companies, recognized at a fair value of 
€63 million (2022: €63 million), and Bayer AG shar es and bonds held thro ugh investment funds, 
recognized at their fair values of €8 million (2 022: €14 million) and €7 million (2022: €8 million), 
respectively.  
The other plan assets comprised mortgage loans granted, other r eceivables and qualified insurance 
policies.  
Risks 
The risks from defined benefit plans arise partly from  the defined benefit obligat ions and partly from the 
investment in plan assets. These ri sks include the possibility that additi onal contributions will have to be 
made to plan assets in order to meet current and future pension obligations, and negative effects on 
provisions and equity.  
Demographic/biometric risks 
Since a large proportion of the defined benefit obligations comprises lifelong pensions or surviving 
dependents’ pensions, longer claim peri ods or earlier claims may result in higher benefit obligations, higher 
benefit expense and/or higher pension payments than previously anticipated.  
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 194
Investment risks 
If the actual return on plan assets  were below the return anticipated on the basis of the discount rate, 
the funded status of defined benefit plans would d ecrease, assuming there were no changes in other 
parameters. This could happen as a result of a drop in  share prices, increases in market rates of interest 
for certain bonds, default of indivi dual debtors or the purchase of lo w-risk but low-interest bonds, for 
example.  
Interest-rate risk 
A decline in capital market interest rates, especia lly for high-quality corporat e bonds, would increase the 
defined benefit obligation. This effect  would be at least partially offs et by the ensuing increase in the 
market values of the correspon ding debt instruments held.  
Measurement parameters and their sensitivities 
The following weighted parameters were used to m easure the obligations for pensions and other post-
employment benefits as of December 31 of the respective year:

The Heubeck RT 2018 G mortality tables were used in Germany, the MP-2021 Mortality Tables in the 
United States, and 101% of S3NMA and 102 % of S3NFA in the United Kingdom.  
The projected future benefit incr ease in Germany was adjusted to 2.10% and would have been 2.40% 
based on the previous estimate method, which had combined long-term expect ations and cumulative 
inflation in a uniform benefit increas e rate (2022: 2.70%). The estimate method was refined compared with 
the previous years to directly acco unt for cumulative inflation up to the next benefit increase when 
measuring the individual obligations  in question. The refined process thus takes into account cumulative 
inflation and long-term infl ation forecasts, demographic specifics, as  well as the adjustment mechanism at 
Bayer. The refinement increased the defined benefit obligation by €38 million at the expense of other 
comprehensive income.

Provisions are also established for the obligations, mainly of US subsid iaries, to provide post-employment 
benefits in the form of healthcare cost payments for retirees. The valu ation of healthcare costs was based 
on the assumption that  they will increase at a rate of 6.8% (2022:  7.0%). It was assumed that this rate of 
increase will gradually decline to 5.0% (20 22: 5.0%) by 2031 (2022: by 2031).

Bayer had previously been committed to making d eficit contributions for its UK pension plans of 
approximately GBP27 million annually, although this fi xed commitment ceased to apply from 2022. For its 
US pension plans, Bayer did not make any deficit cont ributions in 2023 or in 2022, and expects to make 
zero or only very low regular payments in 2024 as most of these plans are closed and frozen.

The provisions were partly offset by reimbursement claims in the amo unt of €20 million (2022: €22 million), 
which were recognized as receivables. These reimburs ement claims primarily related to product liability.  
Environmental protection 
Provisions for environmental prot ection are mainly established for the expected costs of ensuring 
compliance with environmental regula tions, remediation work on cont aminated land, recultivation of 
landfills, and redevelopment and water protection measures. 
Restructuring 
Provisions for restructuring only cover expenses th at arise directly from re structuring measures, are 
necessary for restructuring and are not related to future business operations. Such expenses include 
severance payments to employees and compensation payments in respect of rented property that is no 
longer used. 
Restructuring measures may include the sale or termin ation of business units, site closures, relocations of 
business activities or fundamental reorganizations of business units. 
Provisions for restructuring included €889 million (2022: €1,233 million) for severance payments and 
€13 million (2022: €27 million) for oth er restructuring expenses. The brea kdown of provisions by segment 
was as follows: €125 million (2022: €170 million) at Crop Science, €403 million (2022: €633 million) at 
Pharmaceuticals, €13 million (2022: €20 million) at Consumer Health an d €361 million (2022: €437 million) 
in Enabling Functions/All Other Segments. 
In 2023, Bayer announced the introduction of a new operating model for the entire Group. The aim of the 
new system, which is called Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO), is to ensu re we adopt an even stronger 
orientation toward customer needs and deploy resources more efficiently.  
In late 2023, the company began to undertake its fi rst specific communication m easures to inform affected 
employees and employee representatives, which m eant that corresponding provisions had to be 
established under IAS 37. Future prov isions will need to be established depending on the development of 
detailed formal plans for the planned measures an d the communication thereo f to the affected employees. 
The decline in provisions for restru cturing at Crop Science was particul arly attributable to the ongoing 
severance payments resulting from reorganization measures due to the Monsanto integration.  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 198
At Pharmaceuticals, the decline in re structuring-related provisions was primarily due to the implementation 
of the restructuring plans involvin g headcount reductions that had been specifically communicated in 
2022, and the respective severance payments, particul arly in Japan, France and Germany. This global 
program was aimed at driving a fundamental organizational transformation in step with the long-term strategy and Bayer’s aspiration as a leading science company to deliver groundbreaking innovation. 
The ongoing utilization of the existing  provisions in conjunct ion with the current transformation initiative 
also led to a decrease in th e restructuring-related provis ions for Consumer Health.  
The decline for Enabling Functions/All Other Segments was largely due to the further utilization of the 
existing provisions for the headcount reduction measures defined in previous years.  
Trade-related commitments 
Trade-related provisions are recorded mainly for obligations related to services performed but not yet 
invoiced and to sales commissions not re cognized under trade accounts payable.  
Litigations 
The legal risks currently considered to be material, and their development, are described in Note [30]. 
Personnel commitments 
Personnel-related provisions include those for variable, performance-related one-time payments to 
employees, stock-based payments, an d payments related to long-service anniversaries, early retirement 
programs and pre-retirement part-time working arrang ements. Provisions for severance payments resulting 
from restructuring are reflected in provisions for restructuring.  
Stock-based compensation programs 
Bayer offers the stock-based compensation programs  Aspire 2.0, Aspire 3.0 and BayShare 2023 
collectively to different groups of employees. The Aspi re 2.0 and Aspire 3.0 prog rams are accounted for in 
accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 concerning cash-settled share-based payment transactions. 
By contrast, the BayShare stock-based compensa tion program is accounted  for in line with the 
requirements of IFRS 2 concerning  equity-settled share-based paym ent transactions. Provisions are 
established for all awards to be made under the Aspi re 2.0 and Aspire 3.0 programs. The provisions are 
recognized in the amount of the fair value of the ob ligations existing as of the date of the financial 
statements. All resulting changes in valu e are recognized in profit or loss.

The value of the Aspire 2.0 tranche that was fully earned at the end of 2023, resulting in payments at the 
beginning of 2024, was €135 million (2022: €245 million). 
The net gain for all stock-based co mpensation programs was €153 millio n (2022: expense of €365 million) 
and included expenses of €5 million (2022: €5 million) for the BayShare stock participation program. The 
decline in provisions was primarily due to the development of the underlying parameters to determine the 
fair value of liabilities, such as Bayer’s share pri ce and ROCE. For information on the hedging of stock-
based compensation for our employee s and the resulting additional effect s on the income statement, see 
Note [27.3].  
Long-term incentive program Aspire 2.0 
Aspire 2.0 is based on a percentage of each empl oyee’s annual base salary, the percentage varying 
according to their position. This target value is mu ltiplied by the employee’s STI (short-term incentive) 
payment factor for the previous year to give the Aspi re grant value. The STI payment factor reflects the 
business performance under the global short-term incentive program. The Aspire grant value is converted into virtual Bayer shares by dividing it by the shar e price at the start of th e program. The program’s 
performance is based on these virtua l shares. Each tranche runs for four  years. Detailed information on the 
stock-based compensation of the Board of Management can be found in the Compensation Report (www.bayer.com/cpr). 
The fair value of the obligations is determined fr om the price of Bayer stock at year-end and the 
dividends paid up to that time. The payment made at the end of each tranche is determined by multiplying 
the number of virtual shares by the Bayer share price at  that time and adding an amount equivalent to the 
dividends paid during the period of the tranche. The maximum payment for Aspire 2.0 is 250% of the 
Aspire grant value.  
At the start of 2024, a payment of 60% was made for the tranche issued in 2020.  
Long-term incentive program Aspire 3.0  
Due to the introduction of Aspire 3.0 in 2020, Bayer’s long-term compensation program now includes a 
series of additional strategic pe rformance indicators that are alig ned toward the company’s strategy. 
Eligibility was limited to the members of the Board of  Management in the first year of the program. 
However, since the beginning of 2021, it has also b een made available to eligible employees below this 
level. 
As with Aspire 2.0, the annual tranches are granted over  a four-year term in the form of virtual shares. This 
program is also based on a percentage of each employ ee’s annual base salary (the so-called LTI target 
amount), the percentage varying accord ing to their position. The number of virtual shares is determined by 
dividing the LTI target amount by th e price of Bayer shares at the begi nning of the program. However, the 
individual STI payout factor is no longer taken into consideration when calculating the number of virtual 
shares.  
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 200
The fair value of the obligations continues to be determined from the price of Bayer stock and the 
dividends already paid. Compared with Aspire 2.0, howe ver, there is also an a dditional performance factor 
to be taken into account that comprises three weighted  performance components: relative capital market 
performance (40%), return on invest ment (40%) and sustainability (20%). The final LTI payout is determined 
by multiplying the number of virtual shares by the Ba yer share price at the end of the performance period 
and the performance factor mentioned ab ove, and then adding an amount equivalent to the dividends paid 
during the performance period. The maximum payo ut is 250% of the LTI target amount. Detailed 
information on the stock-based compensation of th e Board of Management an d the three performance 
components mentioned above can be found in the Compensation  Report (www.bayer.com/cpr). 
BayShare 2023 
All management levels and nonmanagerial employees in  Germany are offered a stock participation program 
known as BayShare, under which Baye r subsidizes their personal investments in the company’s stock. 
On November 9, 2023, approximately 576,000 Bayer AG shares (2022: 492,000 shares) were purchased at a price of €41.85 per share (2022: €50.11 per share)  for this purpose in accordance with Section 71, 
Paragraph 1, No. 8 of the German Stock Corporatio n Act. These shares corresponded to €1.5 million 
(2022: €1.3 million), or 0.06% (2022: 0.05%), of the capital stock. At the time of purchase, the value of the shares was €24 million (2022: €25 m illion). The shares were deposited in  employees’ securities accounts in 
late 2023, meaning that Bayer AG did not hold any own shares as of December 31, 2023. 
The discount granted under this program in 2023 was 20% (2022: 20%) of the subscription amount. 
Employees stated a fixed amount that  they wished to invest in shares . The maximum subscription amount 
in Germany was set at €2,500 (2022: €2,500) or €5,000 (2022: €5,000), depending on the employee’s position. The shares purchased must be retained until December 31, 2024.  
Miscellaneous 
Miscellaneous provisions include those for interest payments on income taxes and other taxes, for other 
liabilities, except where these are allocable to other provision categor ies, and for decommissioning and 
similar obligations. 
A sensitivity analysis undertaken for certain provisions that examined th e impact of a five-percentage-point 
change in the probabilities of occu rrence in each case did not produce an y material deviations from the 
amount of provisions established.

2 Date of first option to redeem the bond early at par 
3 Some of the hybrid bonds were repurchased before the first call date. 
Hybrid bonds 
The hybrid bonds issued by Bayer AG  are subordinated, and 50% of their amount is treated  as equity by 
three contracted rating agencies. Th ey therefore have a more limited effect on the Group’s rating-specific 
debt indicators than senior borrowings. 
In 2023, Bayer AG repurchased €1.4 billion in hybrid bond s maturing in 2074 (callable on July 1, 2024) and 
2079 (callable on February 12, 2025) before the firs t call date. To finance the repurchase, new hybrid 
bonds with a total volume of €1.75 billion were placed. Th e two tranches have a fina l maturity of 60 years. 
The first tranche in the amount of €750 million with  a noncall period of 5.25 years pays a coupon of 
6.625%. The second tranche in the amount of €1.0 billion with a noncall period of 8.25 years pays a 
coupon of 7.000%. 
Bayer AG had placed hybrid bonds with a total volume  of €1.3 billion in 2022. The issuance comprised two 
tranches, each with a final maturity of 60 years. The first tranche in the amount of €500 million with a 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 202
noncall period of 5.5 years pays a coupon of 4.5%. The second tranche in the amount of €800 million with 
a noncall period of 8.5 years pays a coupon of 5.375%.  
Other bonds 
In 2023, Bayer AG placed new senior bonds with a t otal volume of €3 billio n under its Debt Issuance 
Program. The three tranches with volumes of €750 million, €750 million and €1.5 billion have maturities of 
3.25 years, 6.25 years and 10 years, respectively. The coupons of the notes are 4.000%, 4.250% and 4.625%, respectively. 
In addition, Bayer US Finance LLC, United States , placed bonds with a volume of US$5.75 billion 
(€5.3 billion). The five tranches with maturities of 3, 5.2, 7, 10 and 30  years have volumes of US$1.0 billion

while two bonds with a total volume of €1.75 billio n and one with a nominal volume of JPY10 billion 
(€73 million) were redeemed at maturity.  
Liabilities to banks 
The decrease in liabilities to banks is due to repaymen t of the €3 billion credit line with banks that had 
been drawn upon in May 2022.  
Lease liabilities 
Further information on lease liab ilities is given in Note [28]. 
Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities as of December 31, 2023, included €1,867 million in commercial paper (2022: 
€80 million).  
Other information 
A total of €4.5 billion in undrawn cred it facilities remained available to the Bayer Group as of December 31, 
2023 (December 31, 2022: €4.5 billion). 
Further information on the acco unting for liabilities from deriva tives is given in Note [27]. 
25. Trade accounts payable 
Trade accounts payable comprised €7,414 million (2 022: €7,490 million) due within one year and 
€42 million (2022: €55 millio n) due after one year.  
This figure included invoices of €224 million (2 022: €215 million) in conn ection with supply chain  
financing programs that were or will be paid to supplie rs by a bank and that Bayer will settle with the bank

Miscellaneous liabilities were dimi nished by €1,230 million due to settl ement payments associated with 
the PCB litigations. These paymen ts were effected in January 2023 aft er having been reclassified 
from provisions for litigations to oth er liabilities in 2022. The decline in  miscellaneous liabilities was also 
attributable to the milestone payments in connectio n with the acquisitions of the US-based companies 
Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc. (AskBio), BlueRock Therapeutics LP (BlueRock) and Vividion 
Therapeutics, Inc. (Vividion). Th e decline amounted to €461 millio n for Vividion and €185 million for 
AskBio and BlueRock in 2023. This results in  remaining possible mile stone payments under 
miscellaneous liabilities of €956 m illion (2022: €1,241 million) attribut able to the US-based companies 
AskBio and BlueRock. 
The deferred income included €27 mi llion (2022: €26 million) in grants and subsidies received from 
governments, of which €3 million (2022: €8 million) was reve rsed through profit or loss. 
27. Financial instruments 
The system used by the Bayer Group to manage credit  risks, liquidity risks and the different types of 
market-price risk (interest-rate, cu rrency and commodity-price risks), toget her with its objectives, methods 
and procedures, is outlined in the Opportunity an d Risk Report, which forms part of the Combined 
Management Report. It also contains more detaile d information on individual market-price risks. 
27.1 Financial instruments by category 
The following tables show the carrying amounts and fai r values of the individual financial assets and 
liabilities by category of financial instrument under IFRS 9 and a reco nciliation to the corresponding line 
items in the statements of financial position. Si nce the line items “Trade accounts receivable,” “Other 
receivables,” “Financial liabilities” and “Other liabilitie s” contain both financial instruments and nonfinancial 
assets or liabilities (such as other tax receivables),  the reconciliation is shown in the column headed

 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 206
Due to the short maturities of most trade accounts r eceivable and payable, other financial receivables 
and liabilities, and cash and cash equivalents, thei r carrying amounts at the closing date do not 
significantly differ from the fair values. Trade accounts receivable are measured at  fair value through other 
comprehensive income if they can potentially be trans ferred as part of factoring agreements. In case of a 
transfer, all of the risks and opportunities contained in these agreements are transferred, resulting in complete 
derecognition of the receivables. 
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities measur ed at amortized cost that  are given for information 
are the present values of the respective future cash flows. The present values are determined by 
discounting the cash flows at a closing-date interest rate, taking into account the term of the assets or liabilities and also the creditworthi ness of the counterparty in certain  cases. Where a market price is 
available, however, this is deemed to be the fair value. 
The fair values of financial assets measured at fai r value correspond to quoted prices in active markets 
(Level 1), or are determined using va luation techniques based on observab le market data as of the end of 
the reporting period (Level 2), or are the present values  of the respective future cash flows, determined on 
the basis of unobservable inputs (Level 3). 
The fair values of derivatives for wh ich no publicly quoted prices exis t in active markets (Level 1) are 
determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period (Level 2). In applying valu ation techniques, credit  or debt value adjustments are determined to 
account for the credit risk of the contractual party or Bayer. 
Currency and commodity forward contracts are measured  individually at their forward rates or forward 
prices on the closing date. These depend on spot rate s or prices, including time  spreads. The fair values 
of interest-rate hedging instrume nts and cross-currency interest-r ate swaps were determined by 
discounting future cash flows over the remaining terms of the instruments at market rates of interest, taking into account any foreign currency translat ion as of the closing date in certain cases. 
Fair values measured using unobservable inputs are ca tegorized within Level 3 of  the fair value hierarchy. 
This essentially applies to certain debt or equity inst ruments, in some cases to the fair values of embedded 
derivatives, and to obligations for contingent consid eration in business combin ations. Credit risk is 
frequently the principal unobservable input used to dete rmine the fair values of debt instruments classified 
as “FVTPL – at fair value through profit or loss” by  the discounted cash flow method. Here the credit 
spreads of comparable issuers are applied. A significan t increase in credit risk could result in a lower fair 
value, whereas a significant decrease co uld result in a higher fair value. However, a relative change of 10% 
in the credit spread does not materially affect the fair value. 
When determining the fair values of contingent consid eration within the “FVTPL (nonderivative) – at fair 
value through profit or loss” category, the principal unobservable input is the es timation of the probability 
that, for example, predefined milestones for research  and development projects will be achieved or that 
sales targets will be attained, as well as the timing of the payments. Changes in these estimates may lead 
to significant increases or decreases in fair value. 
Embedded derivatives are separated from their respectiv e host contracts if the contracts do not represent 
financial assets and are not closely related to them. Su ch host contracts are generally sale or purchase 
agreements relating to the operat ional business. The embedded derivati ves cause the cash flows from the 
contracts to vary with exchange-rate or price fluctu ations, for example. The internal measurement of 
embedded derivatives is performed using appropriate valuation models, such as  discounted cash flow 
models, which are based on unobservable inputs. The relevant models include planned sales and 
purchase volumes, and prices derived from market da ta. Regular monitoring is carried out based on these 
fair values as part of quarterly reporting.

In May 2023, Bayer announced the signing of a long -term structured renewable energy credit (REC) 
purchase agreement in the United States under which up to 1.4 TWh of renewable energy will be 
generated annually. The purchase agreement falls under  the own use exemption in accordance with IFRS 
9.2.4, but also contains a contract for difference, which meets the definition of an embedded derivative 
measured at fair value through pr ofit and loss. At inception, the fai r value of the embedded derivative 
equaled the transaction price of zero. Fair value change s over the contract term are mostly influenced by 
future energy prices and are recogn ized in other operating income or expenses. As of December 31, 2023, 
the positive fair value was €31 million. If the expected energy prices had been 10% higher (or lower) as of 
December 31, 2023, the fair value of the embedded derivative would, all other things being equal, have 
been €54 million higher (€68 million lower). 
The maximum default risk from financial assets that ar e measured at amortized cost and are subject to the 
impairment model is €16,012 million (2022: €15,717 million). 
The maximum default risk from existing loan commitm ents that are subject to the impairment model is 
€1,097 million (2022: €1,108 million). In this connectio n, expected credit losse s totaling €1 million (2022: 
€2 million) were reversed through profit or loss.  
The maximum default risk from financial assets no t subject to the impairment model is €6,565 million 
(2022: €7,208 million). 
A Bayer subsidiary holds a share – in the form of a co ntractually linked instrument – in a fund with which a 
customer finance program was established. This fund is a nonconsolidated structured entity that settles 
payments owed to Bayer by customers on their behalf, whereupon the contractual rights to payment from 
these claims expire and the associated claims are fully derecognized by Ba yer upon receipt of the 
payment. The fund’s right to payment from the cus tomer is based on a separate agreement with the 
customer, the promissory note. The fund is financed by investors who have purc hased shares, with Bayer 
holding a 13.5% share of the fund volume. The fund can hold promissory notes with a value of up to €185 million. The shares are report ed under other receivables and m easured at amortized cost. The 
carrying amount of the shares held by Bayer as of December 31, 2023, was €25 million. The maximum 
default risk is equal to the respective carrying amount . If customers are unable to service their promissory 
notes, defaults would initially be born e by an investor in an amount of 1.5% of the fund volume; thereafter, 
Bayer would be subject to losses amounting to as mu ch as 13.5% of the fund volume, while all other 
losses would be borne by a bank. The fund is not cons olidated as Bayer cannot ex ercise any control over 
its relevant activities.

The interest income and expense from assets and liab ilities within the AC categor y also included income 
and expenses from interest-rate derivatives that qu alified for hedge accounting. Income and expenses 
from lease receivables and lease liabilities,  respectively, are also included here. 
The changes in the fair value of asse ts within the FVTPL category mainly  included changes in the fair value 
of the interests in Century and Pyxis, as well as ch anges in the fair value of in vestments in money market 
funds and mixed funds. Dividend income is reflected in income from affiliated companies, while interest 
income from debt instruments within the FVPTL categ ory is included in interest income and primarily 
concerns interest income from the capital provided to Baye r-Pensionskasse for its effe ctive initial fund and 
from money market funds. The changes in the fair va lue of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting related mainly to forward commod ity contracts and embedded derivatives. 
Changes in the fair value of (nonderi vative) liabilities within the FVTPL cat egory mainly included changes in 
the fair value of obligations for contingent consid eration in connection with  business acquisitions.

Derivatives that form part of a master netting arrangem ent, constitute a financial asset or liability, and can 
only be netted in the event of breach of contract by, or insolvency of, one of th e contracting parties do not 
satisfy, or only partially satisfy, th e criteria for offsetting in the statem ent of financial position according to 
IAS 32. The volume of such derivati ves with positive fair values was €118 million (2022: €188 million), and 
the volume with negative fair values was €322 million (2 022: €310 million). Included here is an amount of 
€109 million (2022: €152 million) in posi tive and negative fair values of derivatives concluded with the same 
contracting party. 
27.2 Maturity analysis 
The liquidity risks to which the Bayer Group was exposed through its financial instruments at the end of the reporting period comprised obligations for future  interest and repayment installments on financial 
liabilities and the liquidity risk  arising from derivatives. 
There were also loan commitments under as yet unp aid €965 million (2022: €965 million) and €132 million 
(2022: €132 million) po rtions of the effective initial funds of Ba yer-Pensionskasse VvaG and Rheinische 
Pensionskasse VVaG, respectively, which may result in further payments by Bayer AG in subsequent 
years. In 2022, Bayer-Pensionskasse and Rheinische Pensionskasse drew amounts with a nominal volume 
of €500 million and €57 million, respectively, from th eir effective initial funds as per the corresponding 
agreement. At the same time, the agreed commitm ent volume in the effective initial fund agreement 
between Bayer-Pensionskasse and Baye r AG was increased by €500 million.

27.3 Information on derivatives 
Asset and liability fair values and fu ture cash flows are exposed to curr ency, interest-rate and commodity-
price risks. Derivatives are used to reduce this risk. In some cases, they are designated as hedging 
instruments in a hedge accounting relationship.  
Currency risks 
Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are hedged  using foreign exchange derivatives without the 
existence of a hedge accounting relationship.  
Fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from forecasted foreign cu rrency transactions and procurement 
activities are avoided partly through derivatives cont racts, most of which are designated as cash flow 
hedges.  
Interest-rate risk 
The interest-rate risks from fixed-interest borrowings  are managed in part using interest-rate swaps. Two 
interest-rate swaps totaling US$500 million were designated as fair value hedges for the US$2.5 billion 
bond issued in 2018 and maturing in 2025. The carrying amount of this bond as of December 31, 2023, 
was €2,258 million (2022: €2,336 millio n). Hedge-related fair value ad justments of €7 million (2022: 
€18 million) reduced the carrying am ount to €2,251 million (2022: €2,3 18 million). No material ineffective 
portions of these hedges required recognition through profit or loss. 
Interest-rate risks in connection wi th the issuance of new bonds were partially hedged through interest-
rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The fair values of these deriva tives as of the issuance 
date will be amortized from reserves for cash flow he dges into interest income and expense over the term 
of the bonds.  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 212
Commodity-price risks 
Hedging contracts are also used to  partly reduce exposure to fluctuat ions in future cash inflows and 
outflows resulting from pr ice changes on procurement and selling ma rkets for seeds and energy. Most of 
these contracts are designat ed as cash flow hedges.  
Hedging of obligations under stock-based employee compensation programs (Aspire) 
A portion of the obligations to make stock-based pa yments to employees was hedged against share price 
fluctuations using derivatives contracts that were settled in cash at maturity. These derivatives were 
designated as cash flow hedges.  
Further information on cash flow hedges 
Other comprehensive income from cash flow hedges decreased in 2023 by €162 million (2022: by 
€181 million) due to changes in the fair values of derivatives. Total change s of €12 million in the fair values 
of derivatives were recognized as expense in 2023 (2022: €463 million) th rough profit or loss.

28. Leases 
The accounting policy options exer cised with respect to leases are outlined in Note [3]. 
Lease contracts in which Bayer is the lessee mainly  pertain to real estate, machinery, equipment or 
vehicles. Lease contracts are negotiated individu ally and each contain different arrangements on 
extension, termination or purchase options, for example. 
Land and building leases in which Bayer is the lessee ha ve average terms of 8.1 years (2022: 7.8 years). In 
many cases, the payments agreed und er these leases are adjusted annually based on the development of 
the consumer price index for the respective country. Bu ilding leases generally contain clauses that prohibit 
subleasing except with the consent of the lessor. Leases of assets other than land or buildings have average terms of 5.8 years (2022: 6.8 years). 
Like in the previous year, approximately half of all contracts (excludi ng vehicle leases) contain an option for 
Bayer as lessee to terminate the lease on a date specified  in the contract. As in th e prior year, roughly half 
of all contracts with a fixed minimum term (excluding  vehicle leases) grant Bayer as lessee an extension 
option. Vehicle leases generally contain a righ t of early return and an extension option.

Contingent liabilities 
Contingent liabilities as of December 31, 2023, amounted to €6,850 million (December 31, 2022: 
€5,563 million) and primarily related to  tort, tax or labor law and other matters in countries including the

The Bayer Group has entered into cooperation agreements with third parties under which it has agreed to 
fund various projects or has assumed other payment obligations based on the achievement of certain 
milestones or other specific conditions. The amo unts shown represent the maximum payments to be 
made, and it is unlikely that they will all fall due. Si nce the achievement of the conditions for payment is 
highly uncertain, both the amounts and the dates of the actual payments may vary considerably from those stated in the table. 
30. Legal risks 
As a global company with extensive business activit ies, the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal 
risks, particularly in the areas of  product liability, competition and an titrust law, antico rruption, patent 
disputes, tax assessments and environmental matters. The outcome of any current  or future proceedings 
cannot normally be predicted. It is therefore possible that legal or regulatory judgments or future settlements could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered, by insurers’ 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 217
compensation payments and could significantly affect our sales and earnings. The legal proceedings 
referred to below do not represent an  exhaustive list of all legal procee dings, but such legal proceedings 
we currently consider to be material.  
Product-related litigation 
Essure™:  In the United States, a large number of lawsuits  by users of Essure™, a medical device offering 
permanent birth control with a nonsur gical procedure, have been served upon Bayer. Plaintiffs allege 
personal injuries from the use of Essure™, including hysterectomy, pe rforation, pain, bleeding, weight 
gain, nickel sensitivity, depression and unwanted pregnancy, and seek compensatory and punitive 
damages. Almost all of the US claims have been se ttled. The remaining provision for settlements and legal 
fees amounts to approximately US$65 million (€60 million) as of January 31, 2024. At the same time, we 
continue to support the safety and efficacy of the Essu re™ device and are prepared  to vigorously defend it 
in litigation where no amicable  resolution can be achieved. 
As of January 31, 2024, two Canadian lawsuits rela ting to Essure™ seeking class action certification had 
been served upon Bayer. One of th e proposed class actions has been cer tified. In addition, approximately 
170 single-plaintiff claims have been served upon Bayer. Bayer believes it ha s meritorious defenses and 
intends to defend itself vigorously.  
Class actions over neonicotinoids in Canada:  Proposed class actions against Bayer have been filed in 
Quebec and Ontario (Canada) concerning crop prot ection products containing  the active substances 
imidacloprid and clothianidin (neoni cotinoids). The plaintiffs are ho ney producers, who have filed a 
proposed nationwide class action in Ontario and a Qu ebec-only class action in Quebec. The plaintiffs are 
claiming for compensatory damages and punitive da mages and allege Bayer an d another crop protection 
company were negligent in the design, development, marketing and sale of neonicotinoid pesticides. The 
proposed Ontario class action is in a very early pr ocedural phase. In Quebec, a court certified a class 
proposed by plaintiffs in 2018. Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself 
vigorously. 
Roundup™ (glyphosate):  A large number of lawsuits from plainti ffs claiming to have been exposed to 
glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer’ s subsidiary Monsanto Company (“Monsanto”) have 
been served upon Monsanto in the United States. Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a 
number of Monsanto’s herbicides, including Roundup™-b randed products. Plaintiffs allege personal 
injuries resulting from exposure to those products, including non-Hodgkin lymp homa (NHL) and multiple 
myeloma, and are seeking compensatory and punitive da mages. The plaintiffs are claiming, inter alia, that 
the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of 
the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn  its users. Additional 
lawsuits are anticipated. The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in st ate courts in Missouri and 
California.  
As of January 31, 2024, Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial 
number of claims. Of the approximately 167,000 claims in total, approximately 113,000 have been settled or are not eligible for various reasons. 
As of January 31, 2024, there have been 19 Roundup ™ trials concluded before both federal and state 
courts in California, Missouri, Oregon and Pennsylvania. In 10 of those trials, the ju ries reached verdicts in 
favor of Monsanto. In the other nine trials, the pl aintiffs were awarded compensatory damages and a 
multiple thereof in punitive damages. A few of thes e cases have been settled later, but in most cases 
Monsanto has filed post-trial motions or appealed the jury verdicts, or pl ans to do so. In our opinion, these 
verdicts are based on numerous ev identiary and legal errors, as we ll as unconstitutionally excessive 
damage awards. Bayer has two appeals pending in federal court on preemption grounds: Carson, pending in the 11
th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and Schaffner , pending in the Third Circuit Federal Court of 
Appeals. 
As of December 31, 2023, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigati on totaled US$6.3 billion 
(€5.7 billion). Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns  in connection with the 
products mentioned above. 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 218
As of January 31, 2024, a total of 32 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup™ had been served upon 
Bayer, including 11 seeking class action certification. 
Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and inte nds to defend the safety of glyphosate and our 
glyphosate-based form ulations vigorously. 
Dicamba:  In 2016, Bader Peach Farms filed a lawsuit agai nst Monsanto and BASF SE (“BASF”) in Missouri 
state court. Subsequently, lawsuits from approximately 250 plaintiffs were filed in both US state and 
federal courts in Missouri, Tennessee and Texas allegi ng crop damage claims ag ainst Monsanto, primarily 
for soybeans. The general claims ar e that off-target movement from the dicamba herbicide and/or the 
Xtend™ system has damaged non- dicamba-tolerant soybean and other  crops. The Bader Peach Farms 
case was settled in 2022 with out admission of liability. 
Bayer continues to receive new dicamba-related claims that could be potential future lawsuits. The most 
significant of those was a claim by Frey Farms, which is a producer of watermelons, pumpkins and other vegetables. In April 2023, the parties entered into an agreement to resolve all of the claims of Frey Farms. With respect to all of the other dicamba cases excep t for Frey Farms and a small number of newly filed 
lawsuits and claims, Monsanto has entered into a mass tort settlement agreement. The settlement will 
provide for the payment of substantiated claims by soybean growers in crop years 2015 to 2020 who can 
demonstrate a yield loss due to the application of dicam ba products to an Xtend™ crop. That portion of 
the settlement is capped at US$300 million. The settle ment also provides for additional funds of up to 
US$100 million to pay for dicamba damage claims made by growers of other, non-soybean crops, as well 
as attorneys’ fees, litigatio n costs and settlement administration cost s. The settlement claims administrator 
is currently in the process of determining claim eligibility and the amounts to be awarded to eligible 
claimants. Taking into account the payments alread y made, the remaining provision for settlements 
amounts to approximately US$70 million (€63 million) as of December 31, 2023. 
Insurance against statutory product liability claims 
In connection with the above-mentioned product-related litigations, Bayer is insured against statutory 
product liability claims to the extent customary in  the respective industries  and has, based on the 
information currently available, taken correspon ding accounting measures . However, the accounting 
measures relating to, in particular, Essure™ and Roundup™ (glyphosate) clai ms exceed the available 
insurance coverage. 
Patent disputes 
Bollgard II RR Flex™/Intacta RR2 PRO™:  In 2019, the Cotton Producers Association of the State of Mato 
Grosso (AMPA) in Brazil filed a patent invalidity action  in federal court seeking to invalidate four of Bayer’s 
patents covering Bollgard II RR Flex™,  a cotton technology owned by Ba yer. In 2020, the Brazilian patent 
office, in the court proceedings, ack nowledged the validity of all four challenged patents. Two of the 
patents are also being challenged in administrative nullity proceedings before th e Brazilian patent office. 
One of the patents, the promoter patent which expired in 2022, is also at issue in a patent invalidation action filed in Brazilian federal cour t by the Soybean Growers Associatio n from the State of Mato Grosso 
(Aprosoja/MT) in 2017 regarding the Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybean technology. In addition to the patent 
invalidity claims, both lawsuits seek a refund of paid ro yalties. Both lawsuits were  filed as collective actions 
and are proceeding before the same federal judge.  Bayer’s Intacta RR2 PRO™  soybean technology is 
presently protected by four patents. 
In addition to the action filed in 2017 regarding the promoter patent, the Soybean Growers Association 
from the State of Mato Grosso (Aprosoja/MT) is also seeking a correction of the expiration dates of all 
three patents protecting Bayer’s Intacta RR2 PRO™  soybean technology, in cluding the now expired 
promoter patent, in a separate action claiming that  the two other patents had already expired and is 
additionally seeking a corresponding refund of paid royalties and reduction of ongoing royalty payments. In 2021, the Brazilian federal court deci ded to grant the requests by furthe r soybean grower associations and 
the Cotton Producers Association of the State of Mato Grosso (AMPA) to  be admitted as co-plaintiffs to 
this lawsuit. One of the two patents, the promoter pate nt, also covers Bollgard II RR Flex™ and is at issue 
in the disputes with AMPA. Aprosoja/MT argues th at the term of the patents had been determined 
unconstitutionally. In 2021, a decision  by the Brazilian Supreme Court – that  the term of patents previously 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 219
determined to be a minimum of 10 years from the patent being granted is unconstitutional, and that this 
term shall instead be set at 20 years from the filing of the patent application – became final. This will apply 
retroactively to certain patents, thereby shortening  their term. However, Bayer believes that neither 
Aprosoja/MT nor other associ ations are entitled to a refund of paid royalties or to a reduction of ongoing 
royalty payments. 
MON 87429/MON 94313:  In 2022, Corteva Agriscience LLC (“Cort eva”) filed a complaint in a US federal 
court against Bayer. Corteva alleges infringement of three patents held by Corteva by Bayer’s herbicide 
tolerance technologies MON 87429 (corn) and MON 94313 (soybeans), respect ively. However, Bayer 
asserts that its technologies do not infringe any valid patent claim of Corteva and that all three patents of Corteva are invalid.  
Roundup Ready™ Soybean, Event GTS40-3-2 
In October 2023, Bayer’s subsidiaries Monsanto Comp any and Monsanto do Brasil were served with an 
action filed in the Brazilian Superior Court of Just ice by the rural unions of Sertão, Passo Fundo and 
Santiago in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS). The action challenges a 2019 deci sion by the court that 
had confirmed the protection of Round up Ready™ soybeans under Brazil ian patent law independent from 
plant variety protection and denied clai ms for a refund of paid royalties. 
Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses in the ab ove patent disputes and intends to defend itself 
vigorously. 
Further legal proceedings 
BASF arbitration:  In 2019, Bayer was served with a request for arbitration by BASF. BASF alleged 
indemnification claims under asset purchase agreements  related to the divestment of certain Crop Science 
businesses to BASF. BASF alleged that particular cost  items, including certain personnel costs, had not 
been appropriately disclosed and allocated to some of  the divested businesses. In 2022, the arbitral 
tribunal dismissed BASF’s claims in their entirety. In April 2023, the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am 
Main (Germany) rejected BASF’s motion to set aside th e award. However, the cour t found that the arbitral 
award was technically invalid because it did not comp ly with a German procedural rule regarding the 
signatures of the tribunal members. According to the court decision, the original  arbitration proceedings 
have not yet come to an end and still have to be conc luded by a valid arbitratio n award that fully complies 
with the procedural rules. Bayer disagrees with the court decision . Both parties have appealed.  
Newark Bay environmental matters:  In the United States, Bayer is a backup indemnitor for certain 
environmental liabilities in the Lower Passaic Rive r and/or the Newark Bay Complex which are being 
satisfied by an unrelated company. Bayer is currently unable to determine the extent of its potential future 
liability for this matter. 
Mine permit Idaho: In 2019, the United States Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) granted a permit to 
Bayer’s subsidiary P4 Production, LLC, for a new phos phate mine in Idaho. Phosphorus is needed for 
glyphosate, which is contained in a number of Ba yer’s herbicides, including Roundup™ agricultural 
herbicides. In 2021, three non-governmental organizations challenged the permit in the United States 
District Court for the District of Idaho. P4 Production joined the proceeding as an intervenor. In June 2023, 
the court vacated the permit. Bayer has prepared a ne w mine permit application and is evaluating other 
phosphate ore mining opportunities. BL M has formally initiated its evaluati on of P4’s application. We and 
the plaintiffs have appealed the court’s decisions. 
Asbestos:  In many cases, plaintiffs allege that Bayer and co-defendants employed third parties on their 
sites in past decades with out providing them with sufficient warnings or pr otection against the known 
dangers of asbestos. Additionally, a Bayer affiliate in the United States is the legal successor to companies 
that sold asbestos products until 1976. Union Carbide has agreed to in demnify Bayer for this liability. 
Similarly, Monsanto faces numerous claims based on ex posure to asbestos at Monsanto premises without 
adequate warnings or protection and based on the manufacture and sale of asbe stos-containing products. 
Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously. 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 220
PCBs:  Bayer’s subsidiary Monsanto has been named in lawsuits brought by various governmental entities 
in the United States claiming th at Monsanto, Pharmacia and Solutia,  collectively as a manufacturer of 
PCBs, should be responsible for a variety of damages due to PCBs in the environment, including bodies of 
water, regardless of how PCBs came to be located ther e. PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for 
various purposes until the manufacture of PCBs was prohibited by the E PA in the United States in 1979. 
In 2020, Bayer entered into a class se ttlement, valued at approximately US$650 million, to settle claims of 
approximately 2,500 municipal entities . In 2022, the court issued its fina l approval of the class settlement. 
There were approximately 84 opt-outs of the class settlement, 62 of which have now filed lawsuits: 
California cities, counties and municipalities (City of Los Angeles, County of San Mateo, County of Marin and County of Contra Costa), Illinois (City of Chicago, City of Evans ton and City of East St. Louis), 
Washington (City of Seattle) and Wisconsin (City of Milwaukee).  
Currently, there are five pending st ate attorney general cases: Delaware , Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey  
and Vermont. Prior cases filed or threatened by Washington D.C., Washington, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia were settled for a combined total of approximately 
US$456 million. The Company also settl ed a pending matter with the Stat e of Oregon for US$698 million, 
reflecting unique circumstances in that State. 
The Vermont Attorney General case is different from the others in scope. In  June 2023, the Vermont 
Attorney General filed suit in stat e court alleging claims for damages related to PCB contamination of the 
state’s environment and its school buildings. The same month, a second and similar complaint (Addison 
Central School District) was filed in federal court (Dis trict of Vermont) by private lawyers representing 93 
Vermont school districts alleging PCB contamination in school buildings. In addition, there is a pending case in Vermont on behalf of the Burlington School District and related personal injury claims (see below).  
Monsanto also faces numerous lawsuits claiming pers onal injury due to use of and exposure to PCB 
products in school buildings. One group of cases with approximately 200 plaintiffs claims a wide variety of 
personal injuries allegedly due to PC Bs in the building products of a sc hool (Sky Valley Education Center) 
in King County, Washington. As of January 31, 2024, nine trials had been completed in these matters, 
involving a total of 65 plaintiffs. 20 of these plaintiffs were not successful as the ju ries decided in favor of 
Monsanto or a mistrial was declared  after the jury was unable to reach a decision. The other 45 plaintiffs 
were awarded a total of approximately US$300 million in  compensatory and a multip le thereof in punitive 
damages. The undisputed evidence in these cases does not, in Bayer’s opinion, support the conclusions 
that plaintiffs were exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs or that any exposure coul d have caused their claimed 
injuries. Each of the adverse verdicts are in differ ent stages of post-trial motions and appeal due to 
numerous significant trial errors. 
In September 2023, a putative class action lawsuit (Neddo) was filed in the District of Vermont by a mother 
on behalf of her three children who attended a local school. She alleges they are at increased risk of 
cancer from PCB exposure and seeks the cost of medi cal monitoring. The complain t identifies 26 allegedly 
contaminated schools, and the propos ed class is defined as all individu als who attended or worked at one 
of the contaminated schools. There are also five pend ing personal injury cases related to the Burlington, 
Vermont, high school. 
There are additional personal injury cases stemming from non-school PCB exposure. In August 2023, nine 
cases were filed in Massachusetts st ate court involving 16 plaintiffs who allege various personal injuries 
from alleged exposure to PCBs in or near a former Ge neral Electric landfill. A personal injury and wrongful 
death action was filed by 169 current or former employees at Clark County Government Center in Nevada. 
These plaintiffs allege that PCBs contaminated th e Center through prior oper ations by Union Pacific 
Railroad at the site. The Nevada action was dismissed by the court, and the plaintiffs have appealed. 
Lastly, there are four cases involvin g seven plaintiffs claiming injury  due to exposure to PCBs near 
Monsanto’s former Krummrich plant. 
We believe that we also have me ritorious defenses in th ese matters and intend to defend ourselves 
vigorously.  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 B Consolidated Fina ncial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 221
To recover costs associated with the PCB-related litigation, Bayer filed a complaint in August 2022 in the 
Circuit Court of St. Louis County for the State of Miss ouri to enforce its rights  under certain indemnity 
contracts. Under these contracts, the companies who purchased PCBs fo r use in their products agreed to 
indemnify Monsanto for PCB-related litig ation costs, including settlements. 
Shareholder litigation concer ning Monsanto acquisition:  In Germany and the Un ited States, investors 
have filed lawsuits claiming damage s suffered due to the drop in Bayer AG ’s share price. Plaintiffs allege 
that Bayer AG’s capital market co mmunication in connection with the ac quisition of Monsanto was flawed 
and that the information provided by Bayer on the risks, in particular regarding glyphosate product liability 
claims in the United States, was insufficient. In Ge rmany, approximately 30 claims by approximately 340 
plaintiffs had been filed and served  upon Bayer as of December 31, 20 23. In 2022, the Cologne Regional 
Court initiated a model case procee ding in accordance with the Capita l Markets Model Case Act. This 
does not include a decision on the merits of the matt er. In the parallel proceeding in the United States, the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, certified a class 
in May 2023. Bayer believes it has du ly complied with its capital market s law obligations at all times in 
connection with the acquisition of Monsanto and its disclosures concer ning glyphosate product liability 
claims and intends to defend itself vigorously ag ainst the claims in all shareholder lawsuits.

Notes to the Statements of Cash Flows 222
Notes to the Statements 
of Cash Flows 
The statement of cash flows shows how cash inflows an d outflows during the fiscal year affected the cash 
and cash equivalents of the Bayer Group. 
Of the cash and cash equivalents, there were no signific ant sums that had limited availability due to foreign 
exchange restrictions in 2023 or 2022.  
The cash flows reported by consolid ated companies outside the eurozone are translated at average monthly 
exchange rates. Cash and cash equivalents are transl ated at closing rates. The “Change in cash and cash 
equivalents due to exchange rate movements” is report ed in a separate line item. For subsidiaries with a 
hyperinflationary functional currency, currencies are always translated at the respective closing rates. 
31. Net cash provided by (use d in) operating, investing 
and financing activities 
Net operating cash flow in 2023 amounted to €5,117 million (2022: €7,093 million). Payments to resolve 
proceedings in the litigations su rrounding dicamba, Essure™ and, in particular, PCBs and glyphosate 
resulted in a net outflow of €2,089 million (2022: €1, 165 million). That total comp rised payments resulting 
from agreements as well as court judgments. Total income taxes paid in 2023 amounted to €1,770 million 
(2022: €2,125 million). Net operating cash flow incl uded payments from banks of €411 million (2022:

December 31, 2023. 
Net cash used in investing activities in 2023 am ounted to €3,517 million (2022:  €2,381 million). This 
figure included €472 million in income taxes rela ting to divestments, of which €361 million (2022: 
€91 million) was attributable to the sale of the Crop Science Division’s  Environmental Science 
Professional business and €111 million (2022: €0 million)  to the divestment of the men’s health product 
Nebido™. These amounts were ther efore accounted for within invest ing activities under divestments.

and Blackford Analysis Ltd., United  Kingdom. The net cash outflow fo r current financial assets came to 
€113 million (2022: €1,828 million) and largely pertai ned to investments in money market funds due to

 Independent Auditor’s Report 
To Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany 
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLID ATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF 
THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT 
Audit Opinions 
We have audited the consolidated financial statemen ts of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany, 
and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 
December 31, 2023, the consolidated statement of pr ofit or loss and other co mprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial 
year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, and th e notes to the consolidated financial statements, 
including a summary of significant accounting policie s. In addition, we have  audited the combined 
management report for the parent and the group of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany, for the 
financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, 
we have not audited the content of those parts of the combined management report set out in the appendix to the auditor’s report. 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
// the accompanying consolidated financ ial statements comply, in all mate rial respects, with the IFRS as 
adopted by the EU and the additi onal requirements of German co mmercial law pursuant to Section 
315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and, in co mpliance with these requir ements, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial posi tion of the Group as at December 31, 2023 and of its 
financial performance for the financial year  from January 1 to December 31, 2023, and 
// the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the 
Group’s position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirem ents and appropriately presents 
the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of those parts of the combined management report set out in the appendix to the auditor’s report. 
Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations 
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated fi nancial statements and of the combined management 
report. 
Basis for the Audit Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the comb ined management report 
in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014; referred to subsequently 
as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial 
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wi rtschaftsprüfer (IDW). We performed the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements in supplementa ry compliance with the In ternational Standards on 
Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those re quirements, principles an d standards are further 
described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of 
the Combined Management Report” section of our au ditor’s report. We are independent of the group 
entities in accordance with the requirements of Eu ropean law and German commercial and professional 
law, and we have fulfilled our other German pro fessional responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements. In addition, in accordan ce with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare 
that we have not provided non-audit services prohib ited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. 
We believe that the audit evidence we  have obtained is sufficient and a ppropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinions on the consolidated financial stat ements and on the combined management report. 
  
 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 Independent Auditor’s Report 230
 Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our profes sional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 
2023. These matters were addr essed in the context of our audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements 
as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon;  we do not provide a separate audit opinion on 
these matters.  
In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 
1. Recoverability of goodwill an d other intangible assets 
2. Presentation of risks arising from product-related legal disputes  
Our presentation of these key audit ma tters has been structured as follows: 
a) description (including reference to corresponding info rmation in the consolidat ed financial statements) 
b) auditor’s response 
1. Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
a) In the consolidated financial statements of Bayer Aktiengesellsch aft, an amount of EUR 32,299 million 
(28% of the Group’s total assets) is presented under the item of the statement of financial position 
“goodwill”. “Other intangible assets ” also include patents and techno logies of EUR 10,696 million (9% 
of the Group’s total assets), trad emark rights of EUR 5,943 million (5 % of the Group’s total assets) and 
research and development projects of EUR 3,541 million (3% of the Gr oup’s total assets) as well as 
marketing and distribution rights, production and other rights and advance payments of EUR 3,183 million (3% of the Group’s total assets). The Company allo cates goodwill to the reporting 
segments within the Bayer Group. Regular impairme nt tests of goodwill and R&D projects as well as 
ad-hoc impairment tests of other intangible assets are carried out by comparing the respective carrying amounts with their respective recoverable amounts. Generally, the recoverable amount is determined 
on the basis of the fair value less costs to sell. Such  determination is based on capital value-oriented 
methods as market values are usually unavailable for the individual strategic bu siness entities. The fair 
value is calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the Bayer Group’s medium-term 
planning prepared by the executive directors and ex trapolated on the basis of assumptions regarding 
long-term growth rates. Discounting is based on the we ighted average cost of capital of the respective 
cash-generating units concerned. The result of this valuation depends to a large extent on the 
estimates by the executive directors of the future  cash flows of the respective cash-generating unit 
(usually the strategic business entity or product fam ily) and the discount rate applied, and is therefore 
subject to significant uncertainty. Against this backgr ound and in view of the underlying complexity of 
the valuation models, this issue was of particul ar importance in the context of our audit.  
 The statements made by the executive directors on the subject of goodwill and other intangible assets 
are contained in sections 3 and 14 of the n otes to the consolidated financial statements. 
 
b) As part of our audit, we reconstructed, amon g other matters, the methodology used to perform the 
impairment tests and assessed the calculation of th e weighted cost of capital. We assured ourselves 
of the appropriateness of the future cash inflo ws used in the valuation by, among other things, 
a walkthrough and critical assessment of the under lying planning process. We also assessed the 
appropriateness of the future cash flows used in the valuation, in particular by comparing this 
information with the Company’s medium-term pl anning and by checking selected planning 
assumptions against general and in dustry-specific market expectatio ns. We intensively studied the 
parameters used to determine the discount ra te applied and assessed the completeness and 
accuracy of the calculation scheme. In addition, due to the material significance of goodwill, we 
complementarily performed our own sensitivity analys es for the reportable segments (carrying amount 
in comparison to the recoverable amount). We also consulted internal specialists from the Valuation 
Services department on specific areas of the audit. 
 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 Independent Auditor’s Report 231
 2. Presentation of risks arising fr om product-related legal disputes 
a) Companies of the Bayer Group are involved in b oth court and out-of-court proceedings with public 
authorities, competitors and other parties. These proceedings give rise to legal risks, in particular in the areas of product liability, compet ition and anti-trust law, patent  law, tax law and environmental 
protection. 
 
Lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages have been brought in the United States against 
Monsanto Company, St. Louis/U.S. A., (Monsanto), a subsidiary of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, among 
others. In one of these litigation co mplexes, the plaintiffs allege that  they were exposed to glyphosate-
based products manufactured by Monsanto, and that  the exposure to these products resulted in 
personal injuries. In addition, Monsanto has been named in lawsuits brought by various governmental entities in the United States, which claim th at Monsanto and its pr edecessor companies, as 
manufacturers of PCBs, are responsible for a variet y of damages due to PCBs in the environment, 
including in bodies of water. In the above-ment ioned litigation complexes, Bayer has successively 
concluded settlement agreements of varying scope with  some of the plaintiffs or plaintiffs‘ attorneys 
since 2020 to resolve parts of the litigations co ncerned. Monsanto is also facing several lawsuits 
alleging personal injury and property damage from the use of and exposure to PCB products. 
 
Whether and to what extent it is necessary to recogn ize provisions to cover the risk resulting from one 
or more of the present legal disputes is determined to a large extent by estimates and discretionary assumptions of the executive directors. Against this background and in view of the monetary amount of the claims asserted, the above-me ntioned product-related disputes of the Bayer Group were, in our 
opinion, of particular significance for the audit.  
The statements made and explanat ions provided by the executive  directors regarding the legal 
disputes mentioned above are cont ained in section 30 of the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements.  
b) As part of our audit, we assessed, among other matters, the process estab lished by the Company to 
recognize court and out-of-court proceedings, estimate their outcomes and appropriately present legal 
disputes in the statement of financial position. Mo reover, we held regular discussions throughout the 
year with the Company’s internal legal department in order to have current developments and reasons 
that led to the corresponding estimates regarding the expected outcome of the proceedings explained to us. We critically examined and assessed the respec tive explanations as well as the information and 
evidence received. We also checked the recognitio n and the measurement of the provisions for the 
settlement agreements already partially concluded as  part of the significant litigation complexes by 
performing sample-based comparisons with the under lying settlement agreemen ts. The evolution of the 
significant legal disputes, includin g estimations regarding the possib le outcomes of the proceedings, 
was made available to us in writing by the Company. As at the reporting date, we furthermore obtained 
and critically assessed external attorney confirma tions. Taking into account the estimations of the 
Company, we also critically assessed the assumpti ons underlying the provisio ns for expected defense 
costs and evaluated the plausibility of the prov ision amounts based on experience from similar 
proceedings in the past and other evidence.

a whole are free from material misstatement, whethe r due to fraud or error, and whether the combined 
management report as a whole provid es an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material 
respects, is consistent with the cons olidated financial statements and th e knowledge obtained in the audit, 
complies with the German legal requirements and appr opriately presents the opportunities and risks of 
future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that in cludes our audit opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an audit conducted in 
accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regu lation and in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits prom ulgated by the Institut de r Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) 
and in supplementary compliance with the ISA will alwa ys detect a material misstatement. Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually  or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements an d this combined management report. 
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism  throughout the audit. We also 
// identify and assess the risks of mate rial misstatement of the consolid ated financial statements and of 
the combined management report, wh ether due to fraud or error, desi gn and perform audit procedures 
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence th at is sufficient and approp riate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. 
// obtain an understanding of internal  control relevant to the audit of th e consolidated financial statements 
and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. 
// evaluate the appropriateness of accounting polic ies used by the executive directors and the 
reasonableness of estimates made by the ex ecutive directors and related disclosures. 
// conclude on the appropriateness of the executiv e directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to 
events or conditions that may cast significant do ubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty  exists, we are required to draw attention in the 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the co nsolidated financial statem ents and in the combined 
management report or, if such disclosures are inad equate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our 
conclusions are based on th e audit evidence obtained up to the date  of our auditor’s report. However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

We do not express a separate audit opinion on th e prospective information and on the assumptions 
used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable ri sk that future events will differ materially from the 
prospective information. 
We communicate with those charged with governa nce regarding, among other matters, the planned

reasonably be thought to bear on  our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or 
safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats. 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we dete rmine those matters that 
were of most significance in the au dit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe thes e matters in the auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

 Limited assurance report of the 
independent practitioner regarding 
the additional non-financial 
information of the Group in the combined management report 
To Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany 
Engagement 
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the following information in the combined 
management report of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany, (hereafter referred to as “the 
Company”) for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023: 
// Table A 1.2.1/1 “Nonfinancial Group Targets Through 2030”, including the statements made in the foot-
notes, as well as the following passages on the Group’s non-financial targets contained in section 1.2.1 of the combined management report 
// Disclosures on the implementation of the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of 
the Council of June 18, 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 under the subs ection “EU taxonomy”, incl uded in the combined 
management report in section 1.8 
// Statements made on the subject of Scope 3 emission s in Table A 1.8/1, as well as the related state-
ments, in section 1.8 of the combined management report 
(hereafter together referred to as “additional non-financial information”).  
Our assurance engagement does not cover external documentation sources mentioned in the 
additional non-financial information. 
Responsibilities of the executive directors 
The executive directors of Bayer Ak tiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the additional 
non- financial information in accordance with the pr inciples stated in the Sustainability Reporting 
Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (hereafter  referred to as: “GRI Principles”), the method papers 
developed by Bayer Aktiengesellschaft and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European 
Parliament and the Council of June 18, 2020 on the es tablishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable 
investment, and amending Regulation  (EU) 2019/2088 (hereafter referred to as “EU Taxonomy Regulation”) 
and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation of the wording and terminology 
contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and th e delegated acts adopted th ereon by the executive 
directors, as is presented in section 1.8 of the comb ined management report.  
  
 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 Limited assurance report of the independent practitioner regarding the additional non-financial 
information of the Group in the combined management report 239
 These responsibilities of the executi ve directors of the Company includ e the selection and application of 
appropriate methods regarding the additional non-fi nancial information and the use of assumptions and 
estimates for individual non-financial information wh ich are reasonable under the given circumstances.  
In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such  internal control as they have determined 
necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial reporting that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent non-financial reporting) or error. 
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that 
are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertain ties and for which clarifi cations have not yet been 
published in every case. Therefore, the executive direct ors have laid down their own interpretation of the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation and of the Delegated Acts adopted thereon in section 1.8 of the combined management report. They are responsible for the justifiability of this interpretation. The legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently. 
The preciseness and completeness of environmental data  of the additional non-financial information is 
subject to inherent restrictions resulting from th e way the data was collected and calculated and from 
assumptions made. 
Independence and quality assurance of the independent practitioner 
We have complied with the German professional requirements on in dependence and other professional 
rules of conduct. 
Our firm applies the national stat utory rules and professional anno uncements – particularly of the 
“Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors” (BS WP/vBP) and of the 
quality assurance standards promulgated by the Inst itut der Wirtschaftsprüfer  (IDW) – and therefore 
maintains a comprehensive quality management sy stem comprising documented regulations and 
measures in respect of compliance with professional ru les of conduct, professional standards, as well as 
relevant statutory and other legal requirements. 
Responsibilities of the independent practitioner 
Our responsibility is to express a conc lusion on the additional non-financial information based on our work 
performed within our limited assurance engagement. 
We conducted our work in accordance with the Inte rnational Standard on Assurance Engagements  
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements Other than  Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Infor-
mation”, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requir es that we plan and perform the assurance engage-
ment in a way for us to assess with limited assura nce whether matters have come to our attention that 
cause us to believe that the additional non-financial information in the combined  management report of 
Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, with the exception of the exte rnal sources of documentat ion stated therein, has 
not been prepared, in all material respects, in acco rdance with the GRI Principles, the method papers  
developed by Bayer Aktiengesellschaft and Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated 
Acts adopted thereon, as well as with the executive directors’ interpretation of the wording and terminol-ogy contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereon, as is presented  in section 1.8 of the combined management report. The procedures performed in a limited assurance  
engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable  assurance engagement; consequently, the level of  
assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement  is substantially lower than the assurance that 
would have been obtained had a reasonable assura nce engagement been performed. The choice of  
assurance work is subject to the pr actitioner’s professional judgment. 
  
 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 Limited assurance report of the independent practitioner regarding the additional non-financial 
information of the Group in the combined management report 240
 Within the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which we performed between October 2023 and February 2024, we performed, among others, the following procedur es and other work:  
// Gaining an understanding of the st ructure of the sustainability organi zation of the Gr oup, and of the 
stakeholders’ engagement 
// Analytical and test of detail procedures to valid ate the processes and data  for the non-financial  
group targets of the Company in acco rdance with the GRI Principles an d the respective method papers 
developed by Bayer Aktiengesellschaft 
// Decentralized site visits to assess the data underlying the information 
// Inquiries of relevant personnel involved in the pr eparation of the information about the preparation  
process and about the internal control relating to this process 
// Identification of potential risks of material misstatement 
// Analytical assessment of the addi tional non-financial information 
// Evaluation of the presentation of th e additional non-financial information 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  
our conclusion. 
In determining the disclosures in acco rdance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive 
directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms.  The legal conformity of their interpretation and, 
accordingly, our assurance engagement  thereon are subject to uncertainti es due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently. 
Practitioner’s conclusion 
Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that  causes us to believe that the information in the additi onal non-financial information of the combined man-
agement report of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen /Germany, for the financial year from January 1 to 
December 31, 2023 has not been prepar ed, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Principles, 
the method papers developed by Bayer Aktiengesellschaft as well as the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereon, as well as with the in terpretation by the executive directors presented in 
section 1.8 of the combined management report. 
We do not express a conclusion on the external so urces of documentation stated in the additional  
non-financial information.  
Restriction of Use and Reference to Limitation of Liability 
We issue this report as stipulated in the engage ment letter agreed with the Company (including the 
“General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüferi nnen, Wirtschaftsprüfer und Wirtschaftsprüfungs-
gesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]” dated January 1, 2024 of the Institute of 
Public Auditors in Germany). We draw attention to th e fact that the assurance engagement was conducted 
for the Company’s purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the  result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitab le for any other purpose than the 
aforementioned. Hence, this report should not be used  by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision. 
We are solely responsible to the Company. However, we  do not accept or assume lia bility to third parties. 
Our conclusion was not mo dified in this respect.

 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
Foreword by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 242
Foreword by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
Dear stockholders,  
On behalf of the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG, I am pleased to present 
our 2023 Compensation Report and updated compensation system 
proposed for 2024. In this letter I addr ess several key areas of focus for the 
Supervisory Board and realigned Hu man Resources and Compensation 
Committee in relation to the compensation of the Board of Management:   
1. Extensive engagement with stockholders and responsive actions taken 
2. 2023 pay outcomes and their alignment with company performance 
3. Compensation in connection with the appointment of our new CEO 
4. Improved compensation system fo r the Board of Management effective 
for 2024  
 
Supervisory Board actions respon sive to stockholder feedback 
Engaging with our stockholders is a top priority for Bayer and the Supervisory Board. We regularly meet 
with stockholders representing approximately 40% of shares outstanding (which is 59% of shares held by 
institutional investors) in addition to the normal co urse, investor relations- driven discussions. As 
Supervisory Board Chairman, I lead many of these engagements and am grateful for the constructive 
dialogue with and comprehensive fee dback shared by stockholders.  
Since the 2022 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, a primary focus for these discussions has been on Board of 
Management compensation. The 20 22 Compensation Report received only 52% suppor t at the Annual 
Stockholders’ Meeting in 2023, and while this was an improvement ov er the 24% received in the prior 
year, the Supervisory Board and th e Human Resources and Compensation  Committee understood that we 
had more to do to respond to our stockholders.  
The feedback from our stockholders is reflected in both the 2023 Compensation Report, which includes 
enhanced disclosures and payouts reflective of perf ormance, and the go-forward compensation system 
effective for 2024 subject to stockholde r approval. While the views of st ockholders varied and were not 
consistent in all areas, we did our best to reflect consensus feedback in  our actions while also making a 
commitment to transparency around our decision-making processes.  
Details on our responsive actions can be found in the table in Section 1.1.2 of the Compensation Report. 2023 performance and alignment with pay outcomes 
2023 was a challenging year for Bayer, and we are di sappointed with how our company performed overall. 
The Crop Science Division experienced significant headwinds due to declines for glyphosate-based 
products. The Pharmaceuticals Division saw declines  due to an unfavorable product mix and pricing 
pressure from generics. Conversely, the Consumer H ealth Division, despite unfav orable market dynamics, 
performed well against its peers, through improving operating efficiencies and price management efforts. 
  Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann,  
Chairman of the Supervisory Board  of Bayer AG 

 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
Foreword by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 243
The compensation system ensures th e alignment of incentive payouts wi th overall company and divisional 
performance while also reflecting th e stockholder experience. This is evidenced by pay outcomes for 2023 
being well below target as the company did not meet the ambitious goals set by the Supervisory Board at the beginning of the respective performance periods: 
// For the short-term incentive (STI), average target attainment was 12.8%, compared with 129.5% in 
2022. This is based on the below-target attainment levels for all three equally  weighted components of 
the STI. Core earnings per share, which came in at €6.39 reflecting Bayer’s operational performance, 
resulted in below-target attainment of 0%. Free cas h flow was €1,311 million, in line with our updated 
guidance, but missed the stretched in centive goal and resulted in atta inment of 0%. Finally, the Crop 
Science, Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health divi sional components, which are based on EBITDA 
margin and sales growth, resulted in attainment levels of 0.0%, 35.0% and 101.5%, respectively.  
// For the long-term incentive (LTI), the first tranche of  the four-year performance period of the Aspire 3.0 
granted in 2020 was earned substantially below target  at 13.15%, reflecting Bayer’s disappointing stock 
performance during the period January 1, 2020, to  December 31, 2023, both in absolute terms and 
relative to the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return. 
Average direct compensation awarded to the Board of Management in 2023 amounted to 13.0% of target 
direct compensation, compared with 87% in 2022 and 92% in 2021, demonstrating strong alignment 
between pay and company performance. 
Compensation in connection with the appointment of our new CEO 
Appointing a new CEO was a top priority of the Supervisory Board in 2023, and it was a task that we undertook acknowledging stockholder calls for a change in strategy an d leadership. We are incredibly 
pleased to have Bill Anderson as our CEO leading us forward as we embark on a refreshed strategy that 
best leverages the tremendous assets of Bayer to  drive better performance and overcome our recent 
challenges. When approving Bill Anderson’s compensa tion package, the Superv isory Board considered 
the highly competitive global talent environment, th e need for a competitive co mpensation level that at 
least reflected what he received at his previous em ployer, and a structure that  incentivizes performance 
and aligns to the stockholder experience. In connectio n with his hire, Bill Anderson was granted a payment 
as partial reimbursement for equity he was required to  forfeit from his previous employer, and was eligible 
to participate in our incentive programs for 2023 und er the performance requir ements set forth at the 
beginning of the year (resulting in a below-target STI payout). He was not granted any other one-time incentives. 
The Supervisory Board thanks  our former CEO, Werner Baumann, for his many years of service with Bayer. 
Werner Baumann is being compensated for the remaining term of his contract (unt il April 2024) in line with 
his service contract provisions. Beyond that, no addi tional compensation was paid to Werner Baumann, 
and his outstanding LTI tranches are not subject to accelerated vesting or early payment and will be 
earned only if the original performance criteria are me t. While these three LTI tr anches ultimately may not 
pay out, the fair value of the outstanding tranches must be reported as a lump sum in this year’s tables based on accounting rules. 
  
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
Foreword by the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 244
Improved compensation system for the Board of Management 
The Supervisory Board and Human Resources and Compensation Committ ee have developed an 
improved Board of Management compensation system that is responsive to stockholder feedback, including structural amendments to simplify the system  and ensure that compensa tion decisions are more 
closely aligned to company perfor mance and the stockholder experi ence. Key changes include:  
// Within the STI 
– Litigation-related expenses will no longer be excluded from the calculation of free cash flow and 
ultimate payout. 
– Metrics align to our go-forward strategic priorities  to ensure we’re incentivizing the right levers to 
drive performance. 
– Targets set at the beginning of each performan ce period will align to our capital market guidance 
(where applicable). 
– The Supervisory Board will have a limited ability to adjust final payouts fo r extraordinary events. 
 
// Within the LTI 
– Greater alignment to long-term stockholder value creation by doubling the proportion of LTI 
opportunity linked to relative total shareholder return (TSR) from 40% to 80% 
– The relative TSR metric will now requ ire meaningful outperformance at the 60
th percentile of the 
benchmark index companies to achieve target payout.  
– Sustainability targets will continue to be weighted at 20% of the LTI. 
 
The updated compensation system will be presen ted for stockholder approval at the 2024 Annual 
Stockholders’ Meeting. A detailed description of th e system, including the changes compared with the 
previous system, are included in the Notice of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting.  While the compensation 
system is typically in place for four years, the Supervisory Board w ill review it mid-cycle to ensure it is 
working as intended. 
Conclusion 
The Supervisory Board has taken significant actions to be responsive to stockholder feedback. These 
include pay outcomes that align with company pe rformance, enhanced tr ansparency around the 
compensation process, and a go-forward compensa tion system that creates fu rther alignment and drives 
the right incentives for our current Board of Management. 
On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I’d like to expr ess our appreciation for yo ur support for the 2023 
Compensation Report and go-forward compensation system to be presented at the Annual Stockholders’ 
Meeting on April 26, 2024. Additional information on these and other co mpensation-related topics can be 
found in the 2023 Compensation Report and in the Notice of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for 2024.

1. Compensation of the Board of Management 
The Compensation Report produced by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Bayer 
Aktiengesellschaft (Bayer AG) outlines the essentia l features of the compensa tion packages for the 
members of the Board of Management and the Superv isory Board of Bayer AG and provides information 
on the compensation awarded and due to each current and former member of the Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board in 2023. Awarded compensation encompasses compensation for services that 
have been fully rendered once the fiscal year en ds. The report thus complies with the regulatory 
requirements of Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations and 
suggestions in the April 28, 2022, version of the Ge rman Corporate Governance Code. The Guidelines for 
Sustainable Management Board Remuneration Systems,  which were most recently updated in September 
2021, are also taken into account.  
Pursuant to the stipulations of S ection 120a, Paragraph 4 of the AktG , we will propose that the Annual 
Stockholders’ Meeting to be held on April 26, 2024, resolve on the approval of the prepared and audited 
Compensation Report. 
1.1 Review of 2023 
1.1.1. Performance in 2023  
Sales of the Bayer Group declined to €47,637 million in 2023. Sales at Crop Science fell significantly 
against the strong prior year  (Fx & portfolio adj. –3.8%1), primarily due to the decline in prices for our 
glyphosate-based products. Sales at Pharmaceuticals were  level with the previous year (Fx & portfolio adj. 
–1.0%1). Significant gains for our new products Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™ and continued sales growth for 
Eylea™ and our Radiology business were mainly offset by declines in China. Co nsumer Health posted an 
increase in sales (Fx & portfolio adj. +5.8%1), largely thanks to strong performance in the Dermatology and 
Pain & Cardio categories.  
EBITDA before special items of the Bayer Group fell to €11,706 million, while the EBITDA margin before 
special items decreased from 26.6% in 2022 to 24.6% in 2023. Crop Science registered a drop in EBITDA before special items (EBITDA margin before special items: 21.7%) that was largely due to the decline in 
prices for our glyphosate-based products. Earnings we re also diminished by a mainly inflation-related 
increase in the cost of goods so ld. Pharmaceuticals likewise recorded  a decrease in EBITDA before 
special items (EBITDA margin before special items:  28.7%). This was primarily attributable to an 
unfavorable product mix, inflation-dr iven cost increases, and R&D inve stments. Consumer Health posted 
an increase in EBITDA before special items (EBITDA marg in before special items: 23.4%), mainly driven by 
our multi-year efficiency progr am, price management efforts and sustained sales growth.  
Core earnings per share decreased year on year to  €6.39 due to the decline in earnings in the Crop 
Science and Pharmaceuticals division s. Incentivized free cash flow in  2023 came in below target at 
€3.4 billion, resulting in a target a ttainment level of 0%. This was part ly due to the aforementioned decline 
in earnings in our core business. 
  
 
1 Due to the hyperinflation-related growth in Argentina and Turkey, currency- and portfolio-adjusted sales growth was adjusted b y  
minus 0.1 percentage points for Crop Science, minus 0.7 percentage points for Pharmaceuticals and minus 0.5 percentage points  for Consumer Health when determining target attainment.

1.1.2 Response to the vote on the 2022 Compensation Report at the 2023 Annual 
Stockholders’ Meeting 
 
In 2020, the compensation system for the members of the Board of Management was presented to the 
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting and approved by a large majority (94.02%) of investors. However, the 2021 Compensation Report was endorsed by only 24.11% of the participating stockholders when it was 
submitted to a vote at the 2022 Annual Stockholde rs’ Meeting. The 2022 Co mpensation Report was 
presented to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 28, 2023, and approved by 52.33% of the eligible votes.  
The table below outlines the concerns expressed by our stockholders during engagement and how they 
were accounted for when preparing this Compensati on Report, along with the compensation-related 
decisions taken by the Supervisory Board in 2023:   
C 1.1/1 
Investor Focus Areas and Actions Taken in Response 
Area of focus Investor feedback and Bayer’s responsive actions 
Litigation impact on   
free cash flow metric Stockholders voiced concerns that litigation payments were  excluded from the calculation of free cash flow for 
compensation purposes. 
// Under the compensation system approved in 2020, litigation-related payments were excluded from 
consideration under the definition of  the free cash flow component. 
// Under the updated compensation system for 2024, the fr ee cash flow metric in the STI will not be adjusted for 
payments in connection with litigation and will align with values published in the Annual Report. 
Alignment of 
compensation system with go-forward strategy Some stockholders shared that the updated compensati on system should align to the go-forward strategic 
priorities of the new CEO. 
// Metrics within the updated compensation system for 2024 will align to the go-forward strategy, with a focus on 
debt reduction, sales growth and strategy execution in the STI. In addition, the weig hting of relative TSR in the 
LTI will increase from 40% to 80% to align with the focus on improving the share price.   
Target setting Some stockholders would lik e targets to be ambitious, simple to under stand, and aligned with external guidance. 
// As previously committed in 2023, targets will be rob ust and aligned to capital market guidance (where 
applicable). 
Extraordinary events Some stockholders indicated that the Supe rvisory Board should be able to adjust payouts in the case of 
extraordinary events, which is not permitted in the current system. 
// Within the updated compensation system for 2024, the Supervisory Board will have a limited ability to adjust 
STI payouts for extraordinary events in line with Re commendation G.11 of the German Corporate Governance 
Code in a situation where calculated payouts do not a lign with performance (e.g., war, pandemics or other 
disasters). The rationale for any adjustment will be transparently disclosed. 
Long-term stockholder alignment  Some stockholders sought increased alignment of performance measures with the long-term stockholder 
experience, including a more ambitious target attainment level for the relative TSR metric. 
// In the updated compensation system for 2024, the propor tion of LTI payout linked to relative TSR will increase 
from 40% to 80% to emphasize alignment with long-ter m stockholder value creation and focus on improving 
the share price. 
// In addition, the relative TSR metric will now require outperformance of the benchmark index at the 60th 
percentile to achieve target payout. 
Focus on ESG Some stockholders sought assurance that ESG would remain a focus in the compensation system. 
// The updated compensation system for 2024 will continue to include sustainability targets weighted as 20%  
of the LTI. 
Compensation for outgoing CEO Some stockholders expressed concern that former CE O Werner Baumann would receive inflated compensation 
related to his departure from Bayer. 
// Werner Baumann is being compensated for the remaining te rm of his contract. Beyond that, he received no 
additional compensation. The value of Werner Baumann’s payout in 2023 reflects our contractual obligations, 
standard market practice and the recommendations of  the German Corporate Governance Code, associated 
with his salary for the remainder of the term  of his contract (through to April 30, 2024). 
// His outstanding LTI tranches are not subject to acceler ated vesting or early payment and are subject to their 
original performance conditions. These LTI awards will be earned and paid out only if the performance criteria is 
met. However, the fair value must be reported in 2023 as a lump sum based on accounting rules regardless of 
whether the LTI awards are ultimately earned based on performance.

1.1.3 Personnel changes on the Board of Management 
At its meeting on February 8, 2023, the Supervis ory Board of Bayer AG unanimously appointed Bill 
Anderson to become Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) of Bayer, effective June 1, 2023. He 
joined Bayer as a member of the Board of Manage ment on April 1, 2023. Werner Baumann and the 
Supervisory Board had previously ag reed to prematurely terminate Baum ann’s contract as a member and 
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) of Bayer AG, which had originally been scheduled to end on April 30, 2024. His service contract and term of office ended by mutual agreement on May 31, 2023.  
At its meeting on August 21, 2023, the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG unanimously appointed Heike Prinz 
to become a member of the company’s Board of Mana gement, as well as Chief Talent Officer and Labor 
Director, effective September 1, 2023. Sarena Lin and th e Supervisory Board had previously agreed not to 
extend Lin’s contract as a member of the Board of  Management beyond January 31, 2024. Her term of 
office ended by mutual agre ement on August 31, 2023. 
 
1.2 Design of Board of Management compensation 
The Supervisory Board sets the Board of Management’s compensation pursuant to Section 87, Paragraph 
1 of the AktG. The current compensati on system for the Board of Manage ment of Bayer AG applies in the 
version approved by a large majority (94.02%) at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 28, 2020. The compensation system is submitted to the Annual Stockh olders’ Meeting for approval whenever significant 
changes are made to this system, or at least every four years. As su ch, a new compensation system will 
be presented to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 26, 2024. 
The Supervisory Board applies th e following guidelines and prin ciples when designing the  
compensation system: 
C 1.2/1 
We ensure … We avoid …
… that we promote long-term and sustainable performance
… that we set ambitious and measurable targets
… that compensation is aligned toward performance 
and success
… that the interests of our stakeholders (e.g., stockholders 
and employees) are fully re flected in compensation
… that we take regulatory requirements fully into account
… that we offer appropriat e compensation in line with
market rates
… that compensation is capped
… that we are highly transparent in our compensation
reporting×… prioritizing short-term success at the expense 
of long-term performance
×… offering guaranteed vari able compensation levels
×… paying special disc retionary bonuses
×… neglecting the interests of our stockholders
×… incentivizing inappropriate risks
×… inappropriately high payouts and excessive 
severance payments
×… retrospectively adjusting targets
×… providing insufficient transparency in our 
compensation reporting
×… overlapping STI and LTI targets
 
 
The section below provides an overview of the compensation system in place for the Board of 
Management. A detailed description of the compensati on system can be found at www.bayer.com/cpr and 
in Chapter 1.3 (Compensation components in detail).

1.2.2 Setting compensation levels 
The Supervisory Board reviews the in dividual compensation levels on the basis of the compensation 
system to ensure that the Board of  Management members receive an appropriate level of compensation in 
line with market rates in the compet itive environment. Bayer conducts benchmarking with its comparison 
groups at least ev ery three years. 
External comparison of compensation 
The DAX companies, as well as international compet itors that are comparable in terms of size and 
industry, serve as a benchmark wh en setting compensation levels. 
The DAX companies are a suitable prim ary comparison group, especially in terms of the aspects of size 
and country. Bayer’s economic position is factored in by regularly reviewin g the company’s relative 
positioning in the DAX in terms of size as meas ured by sales, number of employees and market 
capitalization. On this basis, Bayer aims to ensure its relative positioning within the DAX is in the top third 
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
1. Compensation of the Board of Management 251
in terms of target total compensation. Reviewing comp ensation levels and taking into account size criteria 
over time ensures that the compensation the member s of the Board of Management of Bayer AG receive 
appropriately reflects the company’s positioning. 
The international comparis on group is taken into account as an additional indicator to validate the 
competitiveness of Board of Management compensation on an international level, too. The international comparison group currently compri ses the following companies:  
C 1.2/4 
International Comparison Group for Board of Management Compensation
// AstraZeneca // BASF // Bristol Myers Squibb // Corteva
// FMC Corp // GlaxoSmithKline // Johnson & Johnson // Merck & Co.
// Novartis // Novo Nordisk // Nutrien // Pfizer
// Reckitt Benckiser // Roche // Sanofi // Takeda 
Development of compensation vs. workforce 
In setting Board of Management compensation, the Supervisory Board also takes into account the company’s internal compensation structure in Germany. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board 
compares the average target direct compensation of  the Group’s Board of Management with the average 
target direct compensation of various management levels and the workforce as a whole, taking into 
account both the current ratios and the changes in ratios over time: 
// The first management level below the Board of Management  
// Managerial employees 
// The overall workforce 
// Nonmanagerial employees  
Outcome of the compensation review in 2023 
The Supervisory Board analyzed th e current market trend and underto ok an external comparison of 
compensation, but as in the previous year did not resolve to make any compensation adjustments for 2023.  
The Supervisory Board set Bill Anderson’s target compensation as part of the CEO appointment process. 
Appointing a new CEO was one of the Supervisory Board’ s top priorities in 2023, with the decision made 
following an extensive selection process. In view of the highly competitive enviro nment, especially in the 
international arena, and the compen sation package granted to Anderson  by his previous employer, the 
Supervisory Board firmly believes that offering an attractive comp ensation package was justified and 
necessary to attract the right candi date to fill the position of Bayer AG CEO and thus support the 
company’s long-term interests. S ee the compensation tables in Chapter 3.4 for further details.  
1.2.3 Target-setting and attainment process 
The Supervisory Board aims to set ambitious yet attainable  targets that are in step with the expectations of 
investors and the capital market.  
// The targets used in the short-term incentive progra m are based on the main KPIs employed to measure 
the organization’s operational succe ss in the current fiscal year.  
// The targets used in the long-term incentive system are aimed at incen tivizing long-term value creation. 
Alongside ROCE and ESG-related KPIs, target attainment is largely dependent on the company’s absolute share price development relative to the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return, which serves to ensure close alignment between investor inte rests and management incentivization. 
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
1. Compensation of the Board of Management 252
Using the operational planning as a baseline, the Supervisory Board sets a minimum value, a target 
corridor, a maximum value and additi onal benchmarks at the start of each fiscal year. When setting the 
targets, the Supervisory Board takes into account the planning values, al ong with the following parameters 
and updated information not already in cluded in the operational planning: 
// Market growth forecasts and co mpetition-related information 
// Capital market guidance 
// Analyst expectations 
// Additional factors that coul d significantly impact the opportunity and risk profile for the fiscal year 
At the start of the year, the Supervisory Board also se ts nonfinancial Group targ ets and individual annual 
targets for each Board of Management member. The target  values for these objectives are also determined 
on the basis of KPIs where possible. 
After the year has ended, the Supervisory Board eval uates the performance of the Board of Management 
members based on the level of target attainment for th e individual financial and nonfinancial KPIs. Special 
factors and significant unplanned an d nonrecurring effects are evaluated ba sed on the guidelines in place, 
ensuring that they are hand led consistently when determining target attainment. 
Special factors and significant unp lanned and nonrecurring effects  
Special factors in determining EBITDA before special items and core EPS are described in Chapter 2.3 of 
the Management Report. In additi on, significant unplanned and nonrecu rring effects may arise that cannot 
be planned for with sufficient reliab ility with respect to their occurrence,  timing and magnitude, and that 
may potentially have a significant impact on operatio nal performance in the performance period. In line 
with the respective planning assu mptions, certain effects can – based on a set catalog of criteria – be 
excluded from consideration when measuring target attainment, provid ed they exceed certain thresholds. 
The Supervisory Board is responsible for making any such decisions.  
In 2023, no adjustments were made due to significant unplanned and nonrecurring effects. 
1.3 Compensation components in detail  
1.3.1 Base compensation  
The base compensation is fixed, contractually agreed  annual compensation that is paid out in monthly 
installments within a calendar year. The level of fixed compensation r eflects the role on the Board of 
Management, the area of responsibility and market conditions. 
1.3.2 Short-term variable cash compensation (STI) for 2023 
The short-term variable cash compensation depends on the success of the busi ness in the respective 
year. It incentivizes operational success and profitable growth within the defined strategic framework. It 
also sets targeted incentives to increase profitab ility (core EPS) and cash flow (free cash flow) 
development. In addition, the indi vidual performance of the Board of Management members is evaluated 
using a performance factor that permit s the establishment of further target s, particularly nonfinancial ones. 
The target attainment for the STI depends on the th ree equally weighted financial components and the 
individual performance factor. A cap of 200% is in pl ace for the individual financ ial target components and 
for the STI overall. The components of the short- term variable cash compensation are shown in the 
graphic below.

Group component I 
Group component I is derived from core earnings per share (core EPS) at Group level. Using core EPS for 
this component provides spec ific incentives to raise profit ability in the Bayer Group.

Group component II 
Group component II is determined by the free cash fl ow at Group level. This component is aimed at 
incentivizing an increase in the cash flow available for paying dividends, reducing debt and making 
acquisitions, and ensures th e Bayer Group’s liquidity. 
The graphic below shows the minimum value, target corridor and maximum value for the free cash flow 
in 2023:

Payments in connection with the ongoing liability litigations surrounding glyphosate, dicamba, PCBs 
and Essure™ are excluded from consideration fo r compensation purposes when the KPI for the 
incentivized free cash flow is defined. These paymen ts are therefore irrelevant for setting targets and 
measuring attainment. For 2023, the target corrido r for the incentivized free cash flow was set at 
€5.0 billion to €5.5 billion. The incentivized free cash fl ow for 2023 came in at €3. 4 billion, meaning that 
target attainment fell below the minimum th reshold and therefore amounted to 0%.  
Divisional component  
This component is calculated for each division by setting the EBITDA ma rgin before special items against 
currency- and portfolio-adjusted sales growth in a matrix. Members of the Board of Management with divisional responsib ility are assessed solely based on the respec tive division’s performance, while those 
with functional responsibility are a ssessed based on the weighted aver age performance of all divisions. 
This average performance is determined using the following weightings: 45% Crop Science, 45% Pharmaceuticals and 10% Consumer Heal th. This matrix serves to specifica lly incentivize profitable growth 
in each division. Growth should only  be generated while main taining profitability, and raising profitability in 
the short term should  not be incentivized at the expense of gr owth. At the end of each year, the EBITDA 
margin before special items and the currency- and port folio-adjusted sales growth  actually achieved by the 
individual divisions are compared to the target matrix previously set for that year. Failure to meet one of the two minimum values results in a target attainment level of 0% for the divisional component.

Performance factor 
In addition, team targets are agreed to reflect the co llective responsibility of th e members of the Board of 
Management as a governance body. These team targets are based on the Group targets set by the Board of Management for 2023 and approved by the Superv isory Board. For 2023, the team targets were in 
many cases achieved. The table below provides an overview of the subj ect areas along with their specific 
targets and corresponding KPIs.

1.3.3 Long-term stock-based cash compensation (LTI) for 2023 
Members of the Board of Management are eligible to participate in the annual tranches of the four-year 
stock-based compensation program Aspire on the condition that they purchase a certain number of Bayer 
shares – determined for each indivi dual according to specific rules – as  a personal investment within a 
four-year period and hold th em until two years after their term of se rvice ends. In the event of a Board of 
Management member stepping down before the end of his or her term of office, individual arrangements 
are usually agreed for the LT I tranches granted in that year and in preceding years. 
Since 2020, the annual Aspire 3.0 tranches have been allocated in the form of virtual shares with a 
performance period of four years for each tranche. The number of virtual shares conditionally allocated is 
calculated by multiplying base compen sation by the contractually agreed target rate and then dividing by 
the arithmetic mean of the XETRA closing prices for Bayer stock on the 30 stock exchange trading days immediately preceding the start of the respectiv e performance period. 
The final number of virtual shares depends on the ta rget attainment levels for the three components: 
relative capital market performance,  return on investment and sustaina bility. These three components have 
weightings of 40%, 40% and 20%, respectively. The su stainability component was introduced in 2021. For 
the tranches allocated in fiscal 2020,  the relative capital market perfor mance and the return on investment 
therefore each have a 50% weighting. To determine th e final number of virtual shares, the conditionally 
allocated number of virtual shares is multiplied by the weighted total target attainment of the three (or two, 
as the case may be) components.  
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
1. Compensation of the Board of Management 258
The payout is calculated by multiplying the final numbe r of virtual shares by the arithmetic mean of the 
XETRA closing prices for Bayer st ock on the 30 stock exchange trad ing days immediately preceding the 
end of the performance period. In a ddition, the participants receive a dividend equivalent based on the 
sum of the dividends paid on each conditionally allo cated virtual share during the four-year period. The 
components of the long-term vari able cash compensation (LTI) ar e shown in the graphic below.

Relative capital market performance 
Relative capital market performance is determined  by the difference between Bayer’s total shareholder 
return (TSR) and the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return, which serves as the benchmark index. The TSR shows how Bayer shares performed over the four-year pe rformance period, including relative share price 
development and hypothetically reinve sted gross dividends. This takes account of Bayer’s capital market 
performance in relation to the EURO STOXX 50 Total Re turn. The initial and final values for calculating the 
TSR are based on the arithmetic mean of the XETR A closing prices for Bayer stock on the 30 stock 
exchange trading days immediately preceding the start and the end of the respective four-year 
performance period. The final value also includes the hy pothetically reinvested gr oss dividends during that 
time. Target attainment is determined from the differ ence between Bayer’s TSR over  the period and that of 
the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return. If the difference is zero – i.e., performa nce is on a par with that of the 
index – target attainment is 100%. If the difference is more than –30 percentage points, target attainment is 0%. If the difference equals –30 percentage points, target attainment is 40%. If the difference is +50 
percentage points or more, target attainment is 200%. The target attainment curve for the relative TSR 
target is given in the graphic below.

The four-year performance period of the 2020 Aspire 3.0 tranche ended in 2023. The TSR for this period 
was –45.29% for Bayer and 29.99% for the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return, resulting in a TSR outperformance of –75.28 percentage points. This corresponds to a target attainment level of 0%. 
Return on investment  
The return on investment is based on the return on capital employed (ROCE) at Group level. The annual 
comparison of the ROCE to the weighted average cost  of capital indicates the value generated by the 
company. The ROCE is a metric that is applied as pa rt of Bayer’s corporate stee ring system. At the start 
of each tranche, the Supervisory Board sets a mini mum value, a target corri dor, a maximum value and 
additional benchmarks for ROCE in the final year of  the four-year performance period. The minimum value 
is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WA CC) on the date the respective tranche is issued. The 
target corridor for 100% target atta inment is based on the WACC and an ambitious premium. At the end of 
the four-year performance period, the ROCE achieved in the final year of the performance period is 
compared to the target corridor set fo r that tranche of the LTI. If the target corridor has been achieved, 
target attainment is 100%. If performance is above or below the target corridor, target attainment corresponds to the target function within an interval of 0% to 200%.

For the 2020 tranche, an ROCE target of 9.3% was set for return on investment in 2023. Actual ROCE 
came in at 0.7%, corresponding to a target attainment level of 0%. 
 
Sustainability  
Starting with the 2021 tranche, th e Supervisory Board defines specific sustainability targets for the four-
year performance period that are ta ken into account with a weighting of 20%. Sustainability targets at both 
divisional and Group level can be taken into account.  
In setting the sustainability targets,  the Supervisory Board took care to ensure that these are aligned with 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SD Gs) of the United Nations as a mini mum, and are also in step with 
international best practice, such as the Science Base d Targets initiative (SBTi) , with respect to how they 
are determined, measured and reviewed. Furthermore, th ey are an integral part of the business strategy, 
providing access to new customer groups and contributi ng to greater supply security, for example. All the 
sustainability targets below are given the same weig hting. The Supervisory Board also set a minimum 
value, a target corridor and a maximu m value for the individual sustaina bility targets. If performance is 
above or below the target corridor, the target attainment corresponds to a target function within an interval of 0% to 200%.

1.3.4 Fringe benefits 
Fringe benefits include costs assu med by the company for health sc reening and various work-related 
insurance policies. Each member of the Board of Management has access to a company car, including a 
driver, for business and a reasonable amount of pr ivate use, or receives a corresponding budget. In 
addition, the company pays the cost of security inst allations at each member’s private residence. Work-
related moving expenses are either individually reim bursed or compensated in the form of a flat-rate 
allowance. Any indemnity payments to new member s of the Board of Management for variable 
compensation forfeited on termin ation of previous employment al so constitute fringe benefits. 
1.3.5 Pension entitlement/installment  
Members of the Board of Management appointed after January 1, 2020, are not entitled to a company 
pension plan but instead receive a pe nsion installment, which is paid ou t directly. The pension installment 
is equivalent to 40% of the respect ive base compensation. For the compan y, this avoids all the interest-
rate and biometric risks involved in financing a pe nsion entitlement, and also  eliminates the complex 
actuarial calculations and admi nistrative procedures involved. In addi tion, it means that the members of the 
Board of Management are responsible for making their own pension arrangements.  
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
1. Compensation of the Board of Management 263
Members of the Board of Management appointed prior to January 1, 2020, retain their contribution-based 
pension entitlements. Bayer makes company contributi ons to complement the personal contributions of 
2% up to the ceiling for statutor y pension contributions in German y. The company contributions are 
currently set at 8% to Bayer-Pensionskasse or 2% to Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG on fixed annual compensation up to the ceiling for stat utory pension contributions in Germ any. In addition, Bayer provides 
a hypothetical annual contribution equal to 42% of the amount by which the respective base compensation 
exceeds that ceiling. This percenta ge is comprised of a basic contribution of 6% and a matching 
contribution of 36%, which is four times the member’s personal contribution of 9%. The total annual contribution is converted into a pe nsion component according to the annui ty table for the applicable tariff 
of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG pension fund. The annual pension entitlement upon retirement is the total amount of the accumulated pension components including any investment bonus, the amount of 
which is determined annually based on the net return on the assets of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG 
minus the minimum return on the contributions that is guaranteed under the tariff and approved by the 
German Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). Future pension payments are reviewed annually and 
adjusted in line with th e respective entitlements. 
If the contract of a member of the Board of Mana gement is terminated due to permanent incapacity to 
work before he or she reaches the age of  60, an invalidity pension is granted.  
In addition, the following arrangements are in place for members of the Board of Management who served 
in 2023 and were appointed prior to January 1, 2020: 
// Prior to his appointment as Chai rman of the Board of Management (CEO), Werner Baumann acquired 
rights to a fixed annual pension of €443,940 starting on his 60
th birthday. As of May 1, 2016, the day he 
was appointed Chairman of the Board of Manageme nt (CEO), his pension was switched over to a 
contribution-based entitlement. In connection with this, he received an  additional, vested entitlement to 
an annual pension of €200 thousand starting on his 60th birthday. Baumann was granted the option of 
receiving his pension entitlements from Bayer AG or its subsidiaries as a one-time payment (excluding 
the entitlements existing with the Bayer-Pensionskass e pension fund). If he exercises this option, which 
is available until December 31, 2027, the pension entitlements will be se ttled with a one-time payment in 
the amount of the provisions established according to IFRS. 
// In view of his split contract, Heiko Schipper partic ipates in pension plans in Germany (30%) – for his 
service on the Board of Management of Bayer AG – and in Switzerland (70%) – under his contract as 
head of Consumer Health at BCC AG in Basel – on a prorated basis. Schipper’s pension entitlement in 
Switzerland arises from a defined benefit plan in which contributions accumulate  in an account and are 
then disbursed as a retirement annuity. 
Certain assets are administered by Bayer Pension Trust e. V. under a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) 
to cover pension entitlements resulting from direct commitments in Germany. Th is provides substantial 
additional security – beyond the benefits from th e Pension Insurance Associat ion – for the respective 
pension entitlements of the Board of Management me mbers and other managerial employees in Germany. 
The service cost according to IFRS is calculated based on contractual obligations and actuarial 
assumptions. It reflects the amount , calculated actuarially, that was ea rned by the respective Board of 
Management member in the respective year through their work and that was recognized through profit or loss. It corresponds to the present value of the newly earned future pens ion payments, and is impacted by 
updated actuarial adjustments. The se rvice cost does not reflect a payo ut amount or payments currently 
being made to Board of Management members. A lower discount rate at the start of the year, higher 
anticipated salary and pension increases, and a shorter ve sting period in years are factors that result in a 
higher service cost. 
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
1. Compensation of the Board of Management 264
The current service cost for the pens ion entitlements of the Board of Management members recognized in 
2023 according to IFRS was €1,707 thousand (2022: €2,284 thousand). The following table shows the service cost according to IFRS and the settlement or pr esent value of the pension obligations attributable 
to the individual members of the Board of Management.

1 In the case of the contribution-based pension entitlements, the figures shown here pertain to the service cost for pension ent itlements 
according to IFRS.  
2 The service cost for the pension entitlements earned in the period up until his departure amounted to €458 thousand. The servi ce cost for the 
pension component granted in conjunction with his termination agreement amounted to €864 thousand.  
 
The service cost according to IFRS can  therefore fluctuate from one year  to the next. The existing pension 
entitlements of a Board of Management member cann ot legally be unilaterally adjusted by Bayer.   
1.3.6 Caps on variable compensation components and total compensation  
If targets are not attained, variable compensation can fall to as low as zero. However, if targets are clearly 
exceeded, the payout is limited to 200% (STI cap) or 250% (LTI cap) of the individual target amount. 
The Supervisory Board has set an absolute amount in euros for the maximum total compensation granted 
in a fiscal year pursuant to Sect ion 87a, Paragraph 1, Sentence 2, No .1 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act. The maximum total annual compen sation is €12 million for the Chairm an of the Board of Management 
(CEO) and €7.5 million for the other members of  the Board of Management. The maximum total 
compensation for a fiscal year includes all fixed and variable comp ensation components: 
// Base compensation 
// Fringe benefits 
// Short-term variable cash compensation (STI)  
// Long-term variable cas h compensation (LTI) 
// Pension installment or service cost acc ording to IFRS for pension entitlement 
Compliance with the specified thresh olds for the maximum total compensation of Board of Management 
members cannot be reported on conclusively until all compensation components gr anted for a given fiscal 
year have been paid out. This means that for fiscal years 2021 to 2023, this can only be reported on after expiration of the respective LTI four-year performance periods.  
The respective actual compensation levels for the 2020 reference year were significantly below the 
established maximum compensa tion levels for all Board of Management members. 
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
1. Compensation of the Board of Management 265
1.3.7 Malus and clawback provisions for variable compensation 
In the event of gross misconduct or misrepresentation in financial reporting, the Supervisory Board has the 
discretion to withhold the STI and LT I for fiscal years from 2020 onward (malus) or – if these have already 
been paid out – to require that they be repaid to the company (clawback).  
In the event that a member of the Board of Manageme nt violates a substantial duty of care, significant 
obligations under his or her service contract, or oth er important operating principles such as those 
prescribed by the Code of Conduct for Members of the Board of Management or the Corporate 
Compliance Policy, the Supervis ory Board may, in the proper exercise of its discretion, withhold all or part 
of the variable compensation that has not yet been paid out (malus). The Supervisory Board may, in the proper exercise of its discretion, al so require that all or part of any gross amount that has already been 
paid out be repaid to the company (clawback).  
Moreover, the members of the Board of Management ar e required to repay variab le compensation already 
paid out if it is subsequently esta blished that the audited and approved  consolidated financial statements 
on which the calculation of the payo ut for fiscal years from 2020 onwa rd was based were defective, with 
the amount to be repaid reflecting the corrections to be made. This appl ies even if the defectiveness of the 
consolidated financial statem ents is not attributable to any fault on the part of the members of the Board of 
Management. Irrespective of the above, a legal basis al so exists for payment reductions or regress in the 
event of a damaging breach of duty by  members of the Board of Management. 
In 2023, the Supervisory Board did not see any cause  to reduce any variable co mpensation that had not 
yet been paid out (malus) or reclaim variable compen sation that had already been paid out (clawback). 
1.3.8 Share Ownership Guidelines 
The Bayer Share Ownership Guidelines are also an integral factor in th e compensation system. They serve 
to further align the interests of the Board of Manageme nt with those of our stockholders and to strengthen 
sustainable development. Under the Bayer Share Ownership Guidelines, members of the Board of 
Management are required to build substantial positions in Bayer shares within four years of joining the Board. They must purchase shares to the value of 200% of base compensation in the case of the 
Chairman (CEO) and 100% in the case of the other members of the Board of Management, and retain 
them for the remainder of their serv ice on the Board of Management an d for two years thereafter. If they 
cannot provide evidence of this share ownership, they will not be entitled  to payment of the LTI. The virtual 
shares allocated as part of the LTI program do not count toward the number of Bayer shares to be 
purchased under the Share Ownership Guidelines. 
An overview of the current Share Owner ship Guidelines can be found below:

1.3.9 Entitlements upon termination of service on the Board of Management 
If the service contract of a member of the Board of Management is terminated before the end of the term 
of office – other than for cause – at the company’s in stigation, his or her entitlements under the service 
contract are fulfilled until the termination date.  
  
 
 Bayer Annual Report 2023 C Compensation Report
1. Compensation of the Board of Management 266
Payments of variable compensation are made on the da tes and at the conditions originally agreed, and are 
not brought forward. In doing so, Bayer observes the principles of good corporate governance: LTI allocations already granted are paid out to departing Board of Management members according to the original payment plans and calculated according to the previously agreed rules. 
In line with the recommendations of the German Corp orate Governance Code, the service contracts of the 
members of the Board of Management contain the provision that payments upon termination of service 
shall not exceed twice the annual compensation or the compensation amount for the remaining term of the 
contract if this is lower.  
Change of control 
To ensure their independence, memb ers of the Board of Management are also entitled to a severance 
payment in the event of a change of  control as defined in the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover 
Act, provided certain narrow conditions are met. The entitlement to a severance pa yment only arises if the 
service contract is terminated by mutual agreement at  the company’s instigation or if the position of the 
Board of Management member is significantly affected by  the change of control and he or she gives notice 
of termination within 12 months of the date of the change of control. The position of the Board of 
Management member is significantly affected if, in part icular, one of the following  conditions is fulfilled: 
// Significant changes in the company’s strategy 
// Significant changes in his or her own area of activity 
// Significant changes in th e company’s legal form 
In these cases, members of the Board of Management are entitled to a severance payment of 250% of 
annual base compensation, though this must not exce ed the compensation for th e remaining term of the 
respective contract. This entitlement does not exis t if termination takes place for cause as defined in 
Section 626 of the German Civil Code. 
Post-contractual noncompete agreements 
Post-contractual noncompete agreements are in pl ace with the members of the Board of Management, 
providing for indemnity payments to be made by the company for the two-year noncompete period. The 
indemnity payment for each of the tw o years amounts to 100% of a memb er’s average base compensation 
for the 12 months preceding his or her departure. In th e event a service contract is terminated early, any 
severance payment for the remaining part of the original term of th e contract is deducted from the 
indemnity payment. Upon contract termination, the compan y may waive the post-contractual noncompete 
agreement, in which case no indemnity is paid. 
Unfitness for work 
In the event of temporar y unfitness for work, members of the Boar d of Management continue to receive 
their contractually agreed compensa tion. If a Board of Management member has been continuously unfit 
for work for at least 18 months and is likely to be permanently incapable of fully performing his or her 
duties (permanent incapacity to work), the Supervisor y Board may terminate his or her service contract 
early. 
1.3.10 Payment for service on governance bodies and third-party compensation 
Any compensation a member of the Board of Management receives for se rvice on the supe rvisory board of 
a Bayer Group company is deducted from his or her base compensation. Any membership in a supervisory 
board of a company outside the Baye r Group must be approved in ad vance by the Supe rvisory Board. 
Where a member of the Board of Management serves on the supervisory board of a company outside the 
Bayer Group, the Supervisory Board of Bayer Aktienge sellschaft decides whether and to what extent a 
deduction is to be made. No deductions are bein g made for Board of Management members currently 
serving on external supervisory boards. 
No member of the Board of Management received comp ensation from a third part y in 2023 for serving on 
their management and/or supervisory boards.

employer, customary fringe benefits, expenditures for relocation and accommodation expenses of up to €200 thousand provisionall y covered 
by the company, and the costs of German language courses for his wife. 
3 Heike Prinz’ fringe benefits for 2023 include a one-time relocation assistance payment of €25 thousand.  
1.4.2 Compensation awarded and due 
The tables below show all fixed and variable compensati on components along with their respective relative 
shares for each member of the Board of Ma nagement. Awarded compensation encompasses 
compensation for services that have been fully rend ered once the fiscal year ends, even though actual 
payment will not be made until the subsequent fiscal  year. Due compensation comprises compensation 
that is legally due but has not yet actually been paid out to the Board of Management member.  
The payout amounts for the 2023 STI and the Aspire 3.0 tranche issued in 2020 are included in the 2023 
table for compensation aw arded and due, since the respective Board of Management member had fully 
rendered the services on which the respective comp ensation is based during the one- and four-year 
periods. The fact that th e payouts will not actually be made until the subsequent year is overlooked in 
order to present the link between the compensation an d performance of the Board of Management in the 
same period.  
 
Werner Baumann and Sarena Lin stepped down from the Board of Management of Bayer AG by mutual 
agreement effective May 31, 2023, and August 31, 20 23, respectively. The comp ensation entitlements 
earned until the respective departure date are contained in the table for Board of Management members 
who stepped down in 2023. In line with the Board of Management compensation system, standard market practice and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Co de (especially G. 13), Werner 
Baumann and Sarena Lin have been granted compen sation for the remaining terms of their service 
contracts, as well as an indemnity payment due to their post-contractual noncompete agreements. The 
payments and compensation entitlem ents subsequently granted to them  as former members of the Board 
of Management are reported separately for the sake of transparency, and are shown and explained in the 
table “Compensation Awarded and Due to Fo rmer Board of Management Members.” 
 
Since Werner Baumann and Sarena Lin stepped down fr om the Board of Management by mutual consent, 
Aspire commitments already granted in  the past shall not be paid out un til the end of the respective four-
year performance period. The payouts will be based on  the originally agreed co nditions, and will not be

brought forward. However, as the wo rk duties required for earning the Aspire tranches were performed in 
full, the Aspire tranches need to be presented as awarded compensation according to Section 162 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The respective compensation data shown in the table “Compensation Awarded and Due to Former Board of Management Members” merely reflects the 
provisions established based on the fair value as of December 31, 2023. Payment will not be brought 
forward. The actual payments at the end of the re spective four-year performance period may therefore 
deviate considerably fr om the values shown. 
The service cost according to IFRS is  additionally shown as a part of Board of Management compensation, 
even though it does not constitute awarded or due compensation within the meaning of Section 162 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG).

1 The LTI tranches previously allocated to Werner Baumann and Sarena Lin had already been earned at the time of their departure and therefore 
need to be presented as awarded compensation according to Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The 2020 LTI tranche 
will be paid out in March 2024, in the amount shown above. The values shown for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 tranches merely reflect  the 
provisions established based on the fair value as of December 31, 2023. The tranches will not be paid out until the end of the respective 
performance period, and the payout will be based on the originally agreed conditions. Payment will not be brought forward. The actual 
payments may therefore deviate considerably from the values shown. The actual payments will be disclosed in the Compensation Re port 
following the end of the respective performance period.  
2 “Other compensation” contains the compensation for the remaining term of Werner Baumann’s service contract through April 30, 2 024. This 
compensation exclusively covers the commitments he would have been entitled to had his service contract run for the original te rm. This 
includes base compensation, fringe benefits, STI, LTI and pension entitlements, in each case for the period June 1, 2023, until  April 30, 2024. 
The prorated 2024 LTI tranche is subject to such a tranche actually being granted. The STI for the period June 1, 2023, until D ecember 31, 
2023, is to be paid out based on the actual level of target attainment, with the individual performance factor set at 1.0. Targ et attainment for 
both the STI for the period January 1, 2024, until April 30, 2024, and the 2024 LTI tranche was set at 100%. He already receive d 
compensation for the 2024 STI entitlements in May 2023, with a present value of €525 thousand. In addition, Baumann shall recei ve an 
indemnity payment due to the post-contractual noncompete agreement, which applies for a period of two years (June 1, 2023, unti l May 31, 
2025). In accordance with the compensation system, this payment amounts to 100% of his base compensation for each of the two ye ars and 
is offset against both the compensation for the remaining term of his service contract and future pension payments. The severan ce cap set out 
in Recommendation G.13 of the April 28, 2022, version of the German Corporate Governance Code – twice the annual compensation –  is 
therefore not exceeded. 
3 “Other compensation” contains the compensation for the remaining term of Sarena Lin’s service contract through January 31, 202 4. This 
compensation exclusively covers the commitments she would have been entitled to had her service contract run for the original t erm. This 
includes base compensation, fringe benefits, STI, LTI and pension installment, in each case for the period September 1, 2023, u ntil January 31, 
2024. The prorated 2024 LTI tranche is subject to such a tranche actually being granted. The STI for the period September 1, 20 23, until 
January 31, 2024, is to be paid out based on the actual level of target attainment, with the individual performance factor set at 1.0. In addition, 
Lin shall receive an indemnity payment due to the post-contractual noncompete agreement, which applies for a period of two year s 
(September 1, 2023, until August 31, 2025). In accordance with the compensation system, this payment amounts to 100% of her bas e 
compensation for each of the two years and is offset against the compensation for the remaining term of her service contract. T he severance 
cap set out in Recommendation G.13 of the April 28, 2022, version of the German Corporate Governance Code – twice the annual compensation – is therefore not exceeded.  
4 The total compensation awarded to Werner Baumann in 2023 amounted to €7,637 thousand, comprising €822 thousand as a serving Bo ard of 
Management member and €6,815 thousand as a former Board of Management member, with the latter amount including the provisions s hown 
above. The total compensation awarded to Sarena Lin in 2023 amounted to €5,501 thousand, comprising €1,876 thousand as a servin g Board 
of Management member and €3,625 thousand as a former Board of Management member, with the latter amount including the provision s 
shown above. In line with the Board of Management compensation system, standard market practice and the recommendations of the German 
Corporate Governance Code (especially G. 13), they have been granted compensation for the remaining term of their service contr acts, as well 
as an indemnity payment as part of their post-contractual noncompete agreements. 
5 The figure shown here is the difference between the fair value of the long-term stock-based cash compensation that was original ly reported in 
the respective Compensation Report when the member stepped down from the Board of Management, and the actual payout amount in t he 
year in which payment is made.

1.4.4 Compensation granted to Board of Management members

cost of €864 thousand.

2. Compensation of the Supervisory Board 273
2. Compensation of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board is compensated based on the relevant provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, 
which were last amended by the resolution adopted at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 27, 2021. 
2.1 Principles applied for Su pervisory Board compensation 
A company’s Supervisory Board is tasked with advisi ng and supervising the Board of Management, which 
directs the company and its business on its own responsibility. Pursua nt to Section 113, Paragraph 1, 
Sentence 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the compensation of Supervisory Board members should bear a reasonable  relation to their tasks and the company’s situation. In setting 
Supervisory Board compensation, co nsideration should be given to the demands of the office of the 
Supervisory Board member, the time involved and the responsibility borne by  the Supervisory Board 
members for the company. Appropri ate Supervisory Board compensati on ensures that a company will 
remain able to attract outstandingly qualified domestic  and international candidat es as Supervisory Board 
members. Supervisory Board comp ensation thus contributes sust ainably to advancing a company’s 
business strategy and to it s long-term development. 
2.2 Design of Supervisory Board compensation 
The members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual compensation and additional compensation 
for chairing and membership of Su pervisory Board committees, plus reim bursement of their expenses. In 
accordance with the recommendations of the Ge rman Corporate Governance Code, additional 
compensation is paid to the Chairman and Vice Chai rwoman of the Supervisory Board, and for chairing 
and membership of committees. In addition, Superv isory Board members receive an attendance fee each 
time they take part in a meeting of the Supervisory Board or of a committee.

2. Compensation of the Supervisory Board 274
The members of the Supervisory Board have given a vol untary pledge that, in the first five years of their 
Supervisory Board membership, they will each purcha se Bayer shares for 25% of their pretax fixed 
compensation, including any additi onal compensation for committee me mbership, and hold these shares 
for as long as they remain members. This do es not apply to members who, under a service or 
employment contract, are pr evented from purchasing shares, or who transfer at least 85% of their fixed 
annual compensation and addition al compensation to the Hans Böck ler Foundation in accordance with 
the rules of the German Trade Union Confederation, or whose service or employ ment contract requires 
them to transfer such compensation  to their employer. If less than 85% of the fixed compensation is 
transferred, the voluntary pledge app lies to the portion not transferred. By voluntarily pledging to invest in 
and hold Bayer shares, the Supervisory Board member s reinforce their interest  in the company’s long-
term success. The tables below show the componen ts of the compensation  awarded and due to each 
Supervisory Board member as well as the relative shares of the respective components in overall 
compensation. Awarded compensation encompasses co mpensation for services that have been fully

1 For clarity, the table no longer contains the respective percentages.  
2 There is always a difference between the compensation awarded in previous years (due to a Board of Management member having fu lly 
performed their work duties up until their departure) and the actual payout effected years later under an LTI program. If the a ctual payout is 
lower than the awarded compensation shown for the previous years, it results in a negative amount being presented. If the payou t is higher 
than the awarded compensation originally shown, it results in a positive amount being presented. Since the payout is only ever effected in the 
year after the four-year performance period ends, the above difference is not shown as awarded until the year of the payout in the case of 
departed Board of Management members. For serving Board of Management members, however, this takes place in the fourth year of the 
performance period. As such, pursuant to Section 162 of the Stock Corporation Act, no awarded compensation is usually shown for  former 
Board of Management members in the year after they step down. 
3 During the last year of service on the Board of Management, various agreements may potentially be reached under the respective  termination 
agreements with respect to severance payments to cover compensation components already granted as well as indemnity payments. T he 
severance payments comprise, for example, base compensation, STI and LTI and pension entitlements granted to them under their o riginal 
Board of Management contract until its termination. 
4 For technical reasons, the average compensation paid to employees is presented on an FTE basis, while Board of Management compe nsation 
is not. The average compensation of managerial and nonmanagerial employees comprises base compensation (for nonmanagerial emplo yees 
under collective bargaining agreements: annual salary plus any shift bonuses and allowances depending on the position; for othe r employee 
groups: annual functional income), the annual bonus paid out in the fiscal year (short-term incentive (STI) payout based on act ual target 
attainment in prior year), and the four-year stock-based compensation paid out in the fiscal year (where the respective employe e groups are 
eligible to participate). For nonmanagerial employees, the 13th monthly salary and the contractually agreed vacation bonus were taken into 
account. Fringe benefits taken into account comprised employer contributions to social insurance and, for eligible employee gro ups, the 
budget provided for a company car. Expenditures for other fringe benefits (such as home security equipment or indemnity payment s for lapsed 
variable compensation components granted by former employers) were not taken into account due to their irregular nature.

Report of the Independent Auditor 278
Report of the Independent Auditor 
To Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany 
We have audited the accompanying compensa tion report of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 
Leverkusen/Germany, (“the Company”) for the financ ial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, 
including the related disclosures, which has been prepared to comply with Section 162 German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG). We have not audited the co ntent of the foreword by the chairman of the 
supervisory board that goes beyond the scope of Section 162 AktG nor the section “Overview of 
Compensation in 2023”. 
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and of the Supervisory Board 
The executive directors and the su pervisory board of Bayer Aktienge sellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany,  
are responsible for the preparation of the compensati on report, including the related disclosures, that 
complies with the requirements of Section 162 AktG . The executive directors and the supervisory board 
are also responsible for such intern al control as they consider necessa ry to enable the preparation of a 
compensation report, including the related disclosures,  that is free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.  
Auditor’s Responsibilities 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this co mpensation report, including the related disclosures, 
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in compliance with Germ an Generally Accepted Standards  
for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the In stitut der Wirtschaftsprüfer  (IDW). These Standards 
require that we fulfill the professional responsibilities and that we plan and perf orm the audit so that we 
obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the compensation report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatements. 
An audit involves performing audit procedures in order to obtain audit evidence for the amounts stated in 
the compensation report, including the related disclosu res. The choice of the audi t procedures is subject 
to the auditor’s professional judgment. This includes a ssessing the risk of material misstatements, whether 
due to fraud or error, in the compensation report, including the re lated disclosures. In assessing these 
risks, the auditor considers the system of internal co ntrol, which is relevant to preparing the compensation 
report, including the related disclosu res. Our objective is to plan and perform audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express an audit op inion on the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal control. An audit al so comprises an evaluation of the accounting policies 
used, of the reasonableness of accounting estimates ma de by the executive dir ectors and the supervisory 
board as well as an evaluation of the overall presenta tion of the compensation report, including the related 
disclosures.  
We believe that the audit evidence we  have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  
our audit opinion. 
Audit Opinion 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the compensation report for the 
financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, in cluding the related disclosures, complies, in all 
material respects, with the accounting principles of Section 162 AktG. Ou r audit opinion on the 
compensation report does not cove r the content of the above-mentione d foreword by the chairman of  
the supervisory board that goes beyond the scope of Section 162 AktG nor the section “Overview of Compensation in 2023”.

Report of the Independent Auditor 279
Other Matter – Formal Audit of the Compensation Report 
The audit of the content of the comp ensation report described in this report comprises the formal audit 
required under Section 162 (3) AktG including the i ssuance of a report on this  audit. Since our audit 
opinion on the audit of the content is unmodified, this audit opinion includes that the disclosures required under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG ar e contained, in all material resp ects, in the compensation report. 
Other Information 
The supervisory board is responsi ble for the other information. Th e other information comprises the 
foreword by the chairman of the su pervisory board on the compensation  report and the section “Overview 
of Compensation in 2023”. 
Our audit opinion on the compensation report does n ot cover the other information, and consequently we 
do not express an audit opinion or any other  form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in 
doing so, to consider whet her the other information 
• is materially inconsistent with the compensation report or our knowledge obtained in the audit of the 
compensation report, or  
• otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact . We have nothing to report in this regard. 
Intended Use of the Report  
We issue this report as stipulated  in the engagement letter agreed wi th the Company. The audit has been 
performed for the purposes of the Company and the report is solely  intended to inform the Company 
about the result of the audit. 
Liability  
This report is not intended to be used by third part ies as a basis for any (asset) decision. We are liable 
solely to Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Ger many, and our liability is also governed by the 
engagement letter dated November 23/26, 2023 agr eed with the Company as well as the “General 
Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüfer and Wirtscha ftsprüfungsgesellschaften (German Public Auditors 
and Public Audit Firms)” promulgated by the Institut  der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) in the version dated 
January 1, 2017 (IDW-AAB). However, we do no t accept or assume liability to third parties.
