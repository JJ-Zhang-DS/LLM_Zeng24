Innovations and product approvals 
In March, we announced positive topline results from the Phase III long-term study OASIS 3 relating to our 
investigational compound elinzanetant, which we ar e investigating as a non- hormonal treatment for 
vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. This  builds on the existing evidence from the Phase III 
studies OASIS 1 and 2. We will submit data from the OASIS 1, 2 and 3 studies to  regulatory authorities for 
approval of marketing author izations for elinzanetant. 
Portfolio changes 
Also in March, we announced our acquisition of the exclusive marketing rights for acoramidis in Europe 
from Eidos Therapeutics Inc., BridgeBio Internationa l GmbH and BridgeBio Europe B.V. Acoramidis is a 
highly potent and selective small molecule, orally administered tran sthyretin (TTR) st abilizer for the 
treatment of patients suffering from transthyreti n amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR CM). A marketing 
authorization application (MAA) was filed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in January 2024. BridgeBio and the affiliates will receive  up to US$310 million in upfront and near-term milestone payments 
and are eligible to receive additional undisclosed sale s milestone payments and ti ered royalties beginning

Earnings Performance of the Bayer Group1 
First quarter of 2024 
Group sales Group sales came in at €13,765 millio n in the first quarter of 2024 (Q1 2023: €14,389 million), representing 
a change of –0.6% on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis (Fx & portfolio adj.), and –4.3% on a 
reported basis. There was a negative currency effect of €525 million (Q1 2023: positive currency effect of 
€102 million). Sales in Germany amounted  to €729 million (Q1 2023: €768 million). 
Sales at Crop Science were down year on year, largely due to lower volumes for our non-glyphosate-
based herbicides and in our Fungicides business. We ad ditionally recorded substantial price declines for 
our glyphosate-based products that were not fully offset by the impact of volumes returning to normal 
levels. Sales at Pharmaceuticals were up, driven by significant gains for Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™ as well 
as continued sales growth for Eyl ea™ and our Radiology business. Howe ver, growth was mainly slowed 
by declines for Adalat™ in China. Sa les at Consumer Health declined s lightly, mostly due to lower sales in 
the Allergy & Cold category. 
EBITDA before special items 
Group EBITDA before special items decreased by 1.3%  to €4,412 million. This figu re included a negative 
currency effect of €206 million (Q1 2023 : €4 million). Crop Science register ed a decline in EBITDA before 
special items that was mainly due to the fall in pri ces for our glyphosate-based products. The increase 
in EBITDA before special items at Pharmaceuticals was mainly due to lower expenses for marketing and 
R&D activities. Consumer Health recorded a decline in EBITDA before special items that was primarily 
driven by currency effects. The Group EBITDA ma rgin before special items came in at 32.1%.

EBIT of the Bayer Group came in at €3,092 million (Q1  2023: €2,973 million) aft er net special charges 
of €207 million (Q1 2023: €431 million). The special ch arges primarily related to expenses for ongoing 
restructuring measures and affected all divisions an d functional areas. EBIT before special items 
decreased by 3.1% to €3,299 m illion (Q1 2023: €3,404 million).

Net income 
After a financial result of minus €501 million (Q1 20 23: minus €367 million), income before income taxes 
amounted to €2,591 m illion (Q1 2023: €2,606 m illion). The deterioration of the financial result was largely 
due to an increase in interest expense as a result of higher interest rates, as well as hyperinflationary 
effects arising primarily in Argentina. After income ta x expense of €589 million (Q1 2023: €424 million) and 
accounting for noncontrolling interest , net income amounted to €2,000 million (Q1 2023: €2,178 million).

First quarter of 2024 
Sales 
Sales at Crop Science decreased by 3.0% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €7,907 m illion in the first quarter of 2024, 
mainly due to lower volumes for our non-glyphosate-based herbicides and our Fungicides business in Europe/Middle East/Africa. By contrast, our glyphosate-based prod ucts saw a substantial increase in 
volumes, which was more than offset  by significant price declines as  a result of reduced prices for 
generics. 
// Sales at 
Corn Seed & Traits  increased thanks to higher prices in  all regions. However, volumes were 
down mainly in North Am erica due to lower acreages. 
// At Herbicides , we recorded substantial volume declines fo r non-glyphosate-based products, especially 
in Europe/Middle East/Africa, la rgely driven by adverse weather conditions and increased generic 
pressure. With respect to our glyphosate-based products, we recorded significant market-driven price 
declines in all regions that were not fully offset by the impact of volumes returning to normal levels. 
Particularly in Latin America, the negative pri ce effect clearly outweighed the growth in volumes. 
// Business at Fungicides  was down, mainly due to a decline in vo lumes in Europe/Middle East/Africa that 
was also largely driven by adverse weather condit ions and increased generi c pressure. By contrast, 
higher volumes in Latin and North America had a positive impact.  
 
 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of March 31, 2024  7
// Sales at Soybean Seed & Traits  were level with the prior-year period.  
// Sales at Insecticides  were up, driven by higher volumes in Europe/Middle East/Africa and North 
America that were partially offset by  a sales decline in Latin America. 
// At Cotton Seed , volumes were down in North America amid shifts in demand into the second quarter. 
// Business at Vegetable Seeds  expanded thanks to higher prices in all regions. 
// The reporting unit “Other”  benefited from advance sales in the oth er parts of our seed portfolio. By 
contrast, we recorded declines at SeedGrowth as well as in th e remaining Environmental Science

Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  at Crop Science decreased  by 12.8% to €2,8 49 million in the first quarter of

First quarter of 2024 
Sales 
In the Pharmaceuticals Division, we increased sales by  3.9% (Fx & portfolio adj. ) to €4,358 million in the 
first quarter of 2024. We registered significant ga ins for our new products Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™, and 
also posted continued sales grow th for Eylea™ and our Radiology business. By contrast, negative 
developments included a decline in Adalat™ sales due to tender procedures in China. 
// We registered a slight increase in  sales for our oral anticoagulant Xarelto™  following a weak prior-year 
quarter. Gains in Europe were mainly offset by dec lines in Canada. Overall, business was held back by 
competitive pressure from generic products, as exp ected. License revenues – recognized as sales – in 
the United States, where Xarelto™ is marketed by  a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, were down 
against the prior-year quarter. 
// Sales of our ophthalmology drug Eylea™  advanced thanks to higher vo lumes and prices, with business 
benefiting particularly from increased volumes in Canada. 
// Sales of our cancer drug Nubeqa™  grew significantly, with gains in all regions. The product therefore 
maintained its growth momentum, especially in th e United States, Europe and China, with strong 
increases in volumes. 
// We also achieved considerable gains with Kerendia™ , our product for the treatment of patients with 
chronic kidney disease associated with  type 2 diabetes, mainly thanks to  a substantial rise in volumes in 
the United States. The expansion of business in Chin a also contributed to th e positive development. 
// Sales of our pulmonary hypertension treatment Adempas™  rose significantly, especially in the United 
States. As in the past, sales r eflected the proportionate recognition of the upfront and milestone 
payments resulting from the sGC collabora tion with Merck & Co., United States. 
// Our Kogenate™/Kovaltry™/Jivi™  blood-clotting medicines saw a strong  decline in sales as a result of 
competitive pressure, particul arly in the United States. 
 
 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of March 31, 2024  9
// Sales of our YAZ™/Yasmin™/Yasminelle™  line of oral contraceptives  developed very positively 
compared with a weak prior-year quarter. 
// We recorded significant declines for Aspirin™ Cardio , our product for secondary prevention of heart 
attacks, with business down in China in particular. 
// Sales of our cancer drug Stivarga™  also fell markedly, especia lly in the United States. 
// Our Radiology business cont inued to post encouraging gains, especially for CT Fluid Delivery  and

Earnings 
We increased EBITDA before special items  at Pharmaceuticals by 8.0% to €1,194 million in the first 
quarter of 2024 (Q1 2023: €1,106 million). Higher investments in R& D activities for our cell and gene 
therapy and chemoproteomics technologies were offset  by significantly lower expenses for projects in 
advanced clinical development. With respect to our sales activities, our cost management efforts 
generated savings, especially for our more mature pr oducts, that clearly outwei ghed the increase in costs 
for our new products. To a lesser extent, earnings also benefited from higher income from the sale of noncore businesses. There was a hi gh negative currency effect of €127  million (Q1 2023: €6 million). The 
EBITDA margin before special items increa sed by 2.3 percentage points to 27.4%. 
EBIT  came in at €872 million (Q1 2023: €806 million) in the first quarter of  2024 after net special charges 
of €96 million (Q1 2023: €42 million) that mainly  related to ongoing re structuring projects.

First quarter of 2024 
Sales 
Sales at Consumer Health declined by 1.8% (Fx & po rtfolio adj.) to €1,432 million in the first quarter of 
2024. We experienced reduced customer demand followi ng a strong previous quar ter in which inventories 
were replenished due to an improved supply situation. In addition, business in the Allergy & Cold category 
was down significantly due to a weaker cold season. By contrast, we registered encouraging gains at  
Digestive Health amid an improved supply situation.  Sales were also up in the Dermatology category, 
partly thanks to Bepanthen™. 
// We recorded encouraging sales growth in Europe/Middle East/Africa . The Digestive Health category 
achieved double-digit percentage growth, mainly  driven by Iberogast™  and Rennie™. We also 
recorded a strong increase in sa les at Nutritionals. Business in the Allergy & Cold category was 
down substantially due to weaker demand for coug h and cold products. Sales also decreased at 
Pain & Cardio. 
// Sales in North America  decreased significantly, with declines in all categories that were partly due to 
customers optimizing their inventories. This deve lopment primarily impacted the allergy business, 
especially compared with the strong  prior-year quarter, and the Pain  & Cardio category. In addition, 
sales of cough and cold products were  held back by a weaker season.  
// Business in Asia/Pacific  was down significantly. We registered a particularly large decl ine at Nutritionals 
amid a weaker market environment, especially in Australia and Southeast Asia. The Allergy & Cold and 
Pain & Cardio categories also saw a drop in sales ag ainst a strong prior year. By contrast, we recorded 
substantial growth at Dermatolgy, mainly driven by Kang Wang™, wh ich performed particularly well in 
China, and Bepanthen™. 
// We recorded strong sales growth (Fx & portfolio adj.) in Latin America , especially at Pain & Cardio, 
thanks to Actron™ and the Aspirin™ product family, an d at Nutritionals, largel y driven by Supradyn™ 
and Redoxon™. By contra st, the Allergy & Cold business declined.

Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  at Consumer Health dec lined by 12.7% to €331 millio n in the first quarter of 
2024 (Q1 2023: €379 million) , mainly due to negative currency effect s of €46 million (Q1 2023: €4 million). 
We were largely able to offset the decline in sales, an  inflation-driven rise in co sts, and higher investments 
in marketing our innovative produc ts thanks to our continuous cost and price management efforts. In 
addition, we generated higher income from the sale of minor, nonstrategic brands. The EBITDA margin 
before special items declined by 1.0 percentage point to 23.1%. 
EBIT  came in at €229 million (Q1 2023: €282 million) in the first quarter of  2024 after special charges of 
€9 million (Q1 2023: €6 million) relating to restructuring.

inflows mainly related to the sale of investments in  money market funds to cover operational liquidity 
needs. 
// Cash outflows for acquisitions came in at €95 millio n (Q1 2023: €129 million). This figure included a 
milestone payment in connection with the acquisi tion of the company Asklepios BioPharmaceutical,

// Net financial debt of the Bayer Group increased by  €3.0 billion to €37.5 billion in the first quarter of 
2024 (December 31, 2023: €34.5 billion) , mainly as a result of cash ou tflows from operating activities

Legal Risks 
To find out more about the Bayer Group’s legal risks, please see Note 30 to the consolidated financial 
statements in the Bayer Annual Re port 2023, which can be download ed at www.bayer.com. Since the 
Bayer Annual Report 2023, the following significant ch anges have occurred in respect of the legal risks: 
Roundup™ (glyphosate):  A large number of lawsuits from plainti ffs claiming to have been exposed to 
glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer’ s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon 
Monsanto in the United States. Glyp hosate is the active ingredient co ntained in a number of Monsanto’s 
herbicides. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those products. As of April 23, 2024, Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was cl ose to settling in a substantial number of claims. 
Of the approximately 170,000 claims in total, approxim ately 113,000 have been se ttled or are not eligible 
for various reasons. 
As of April 23, 2024, there have been 23 Roundup™ trials concluded before both federal and state courts 
in California, Missouri, Oregon, Arkansas, Delaware and Pennsylvania. In fourteen of those trials, favorable 
outcomes were achieved on behalf of Monsanto, includ ing eleven defense verdicts , one hung jury resulting 
in a mistrial, one directed verdict on behalf of Mo nsanto, and one dismissal of plaintiff’s claims with 
prejudice mid-trial. In the other nine trials, the pl aintiffs were awarded compensatory damages and, in 
most cases, punitive damages.    
PCBs:  Bayer’s subsidiary Monsanto has been named in lawsuits brought by various governmental entities 
in the United States claiming th at Monsanto, Pharmacia and Solutia,  collectively as a manufacturer of 
PCBs, should be responsible for a variety of damages due to PCBs in the environment, including bodies of 
water. PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for various purposes until th e manufacture of PCBs was 
prohibited by the EPA in the United States in 1979. In April 2024, the Maine Attorney General filed suit in 
state court alleging claims for damages related to PCB contamination of the state’ s environment, so that 
there are now six attorney general cases pending. In  May 2024, the Court of Appeals for the State of 
Washington handed down its opinion in the first of th e Sky Valley Education Center (SVEC) personal injury 
cases to go to trial (Erickso n et al.). The Court of Appeals reversed  the lower-court decision and remanded 
the cases for further proceedings, e liminating the entirety of the comp ensatory and punitive damages in 
that case, based on multiple trial er rors. Many of the identified errors  should, in Bayer’s opinion, carry 
through the other SVEC trials to date. The plaintiffs are expected to appeal the decision to the Washington Supreme Court.  
Shareholder litigation concer ning Monsanto acquisition:  In Germany and the Unit ed States, investors 
have filed lawsuits claiming damages suffered due to the drop in the company’s share price. Plaintiffs 
allege that the company’s capital market communicat ion in connection with the acquisition of Monsanto 
was flawed. In the German proceedings, approximately 280 plaintiffs withdrew their claims, so that in 
Germany claims of approximately 55 plaintiffs remained as of March 31, 2024.
