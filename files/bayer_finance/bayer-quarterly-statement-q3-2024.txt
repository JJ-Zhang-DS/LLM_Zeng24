Key Events 
Innovations and product approvals 
In September, we received regulato ry approval for the Eylea™ 8 mg pre-filled syringe in the European 
Union. The pre-filled syringe provides  ophthalmologists with an efficient and simple way to deliver Eylea™ 
8 mg for the approved indications of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). 
Also in September, we filed a New Drug Applicatio n (NDA) with the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for a third indication for ou r cancer drug darolutamide (brand  name Nubeqa™), followed by a 
Marketing Authorisation Applicatio n (MAA) with the European Medici nes Agency (EMA) in October. The 
submission, based on the Phase III ARANOTE trial, is for the use of darolutamide in combination with 
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT ) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC). 
In October, we announced that the FDA had accepte d our NDA for elinzanetant, our investigational 
compound for the non-horm onal treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with 
menopause. In the same month, we announced that we had submitted an MAA for elinzanetant to the EMA. These applications are based on the Phase III OASIS 1, 2 and 3 trials. 
Financing activities 
In September, we issued €750 million in new hybr id bonds that were several times oversubscribed. 
The bonds were sold exclusively to institutional invest ors. The proceeds were us ed for general corporate 
purposes, including financing the repurchase of hybrid bonds before the first call date. 
Board of Management 
The Supervisory Board of Bayer AG ha s extended the current contract of  Wolfgang Nickl, Chief Financial 
Officer, until May 31, 2026. Th is comes after Nickl requested to extend his term of office by only one year. 
Earnings Performance of the Bayer Group1 
Third quarter of 2024 
Group sales 
Group sales came in at €9,968 million in the thir d quarter of 2024 (Q3 2023: €10,342 million;  
Fx & portfolio adj.: +0.6%; repo rted: –3.6%). There was a negative  currency effect of €436 million 
(Q3 2023: €742 million). Sales in Germany amo unted to €547 million (Q3 2023: €512 million). 
Sales at Crop Science were down year on year. Fungicide and insecticide sales increased substantially, 
while business with our glyphosate-based herbicides and corn seed declined significantly. Sales at 
Pharmaceuticals were up, largely driven by signif icant gains for Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™ and further 
increases for Eylea™ and our Radiology business. Howe ver, growth was mainly held back by anticipated 
declines for Xarelto™. Sales at Consumer Health also  increased, largely thanks to growth in the Pain & 
Cardio and Dermatology categories. 
EBITDA before special items 
Group EBITDA before special items d ecreased by 25.8% to €1,251 million. This figure included a negative 
currency effect of €94 million (Q3 2023: €31 million). Over all, third-quarter earnings were also negatively 
impacted by allocations to  provisions for the Group-wide short-term incentive (STI) program based on 
revised target-attainment expectatio ns at the divisional level (STI effect). The impact on earnings was

by the Bayer Group.”  
 
 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of September 30, 2024  4
negative at Pharmaceuticals but positi ve at Crop Science and Consumer Health. At Crop Science, EBITDA 
before special items was above the prior-year level,  due to the STI effect and a decrease in the cost of 
goods sold. By contrast, earnings were negatively impa cted by the slight decline in business performance. 
At Pharmaceuticals, we recorded a d ecrease in EBITDA before special item s that was primarily attributable 
to a negative currency effect, the STI effect and shifts in the product mix. EBITDA before special items at 
Consumer Health was up, mainly  driven by the STI effect and a positive currency effect. The Group 
EBITDA margin before speci al items came in at 12.6%. 
Depreciation, amortization and impairments  
Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses – net of impairment loss reversals – amounted to 
€4,761 million (Q3 2023: €4,930 millio n). They comprised €4,320 million (Q3 2023: €4,481 million) in 
amortization and impairments on in tangible assets and €441 million (Q3 2023: €449 million) in depreciation 
and impairments on property, plant and equipment. Im pairment losses, net of impairment loss reversals, 
totaled €3,825 million (Q3 2023: €4 ,025 million), with intangible a ssets accounting for €3,785 million 
(Q3 2023: €3,978 million). Due to the weaker-than-anticipated developmen t of the agricultural market 
environment, it became necessary to conduct impairment  testing in the Crop Science Division in the third 
quarter of 2024. This resulted in  the recognition of non-cash impair ment losses of €3,777 million on 
intangible assets.  
Overall, a total of €3,777 million in impairment losses, net of impairment loss reversals, were recognized as 
special items in the various cate gories (Q3 2023: €3,954 million).  
EBIT and special items 
Group EBIT came in at minus €3, 822 million (Q3 2023: minus €3,594 m illion). This figure included net 
special charges of €4,088 million (Q3 2023: €4,303 million) that main ly related to the aforementioned 
impairment losses in the Crop Scie nce Division and were primarily allo cated to other operating expenses. 
EBIT before special items decreased by 62.3% to €267 million (Q3 2023: €709 million).

Net income 
After a financial result of minus €525 million (Q3 20 23: minus €703 million), income before income taxes 
amounted to minus €4,347 million (Q3 2023: minus €4,297 million). The impr ovement in the financial result 
was mainly driven by an improvement in the ne t amounts of exchange gains and losses and of 
miscellaneous financial income and expenses. After income from income taxes of €153 million (Q3 2023: income tax expense of €280 million)  and accounting for noncontrolling in terest, net income amounted to 
minus €4,183 million (Q3 2023:  minus €4,569 million).

Core earnings per share 
Core earnings per share decreased by 36.8% to €0.24 (Q3 2023: €0.38), mainly due to the decline in earnings at the Pharmaceuticals Division.  
Earnings per share (total) came in at minus €4.26  (Q3 2023: minus €4.66). The difference between this 
figure and the one for core earnings  per share is mainly due to the impa irment losses mentioned above.

quarter (Q3 2023: €2,579 million), mainly due to ex penses for our restructuring programs and the 
aforementioned STI effect.

Third quarter of 2024 
Sales 
Sales at Crop Science declined by 3.6% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €3,986 m illion in the third quarter of 2024. 
Fungicide and insecticide sales increased substant ially, while business with our glyphosate-based 
herbicides declined significantly. In Latin America, we also saw a significant acreage decline for corn that 
impacted our corn seed and rela ted crop-protection businesses.  
 // At 
Corn Seed & Traits , we saw an overall acreage decline, primar ily driven by Latin America, and higher 
returns in North America.  
// Our Herbicides  business recorded significant volume declin es for glyphosate-based products, largely 
due to purchasing patterns normalizing in Latin and North America. Higher pri ces in North America had 
a positive impact but were partly offset by price declines in Latin America. Sales of non-glyphosate-
based products increased slight ly, primarily driven by higher prices in North America.  
// At Fungicides , we achieved strong sales growth thanks to increased volumes in all regions. 
// Sales at Soybean Seed & Traits  declined slightly, largely due to a we ather-related delay to the start of 
the season in Latin America. This was only partially offset by higher license revenue in North America. 
// Our Insecticides  business increased sales significantly, mainly driven by higher volumes in Latin America.  
// Our Vegetable Seeds  business recorded encouraging gains that were largely driven by higher volumes 
and prices in Latin America. 
// Sales in the reporting unit Other  were up, partly thanks to higher prices in the SeedGrowth business.

Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  at Crop Science increased to €35 million in the third quarter of 2024 
(Q3 2023: minus €24 million), mainly due to the aforementioned STI effect and a decrease in the cost of 
goods sold. Earnings were negatively impacted by the slight decline in sales. There was a positive 
currency effect of €32 million (Q3 2023: €121 million). Th e EBITDA margin before special items rose by 
1.4 percentage points to 0.9%. 
EBIT  came in at minus €4,420 million in the third quarter of 2024 (Q3 2023: minus €4,573 million) after net 
special charges of €3,869 million (Q3  2023: €3,964 million). The special charges primarily related to the 
aforementioned impairment losses, which, in turn, we re mainly recognized on goodwill (€3,267 million).

Third quarter of 2024 
Sales 
In the Pharmaceuticals Division, we increased sales by  2.3% (Fx & portfolio adj. ) to €4,510 million in the 
third quarter of 2024. We registered significant gains for our new products Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™, and also posted continued sales growth  for Eylea™ and our Radiology bu siness. By contrast, business was 
mainly held back by declines for Xa relto™ due to patent expirations.  
// As expected, sales of our oral anticoagulant 
Xarelto™  decreased markedly as a result of competitive 
pressure from generics, especially in Europe and Canada. License revenues – recognized as sales – in 
the United States, where Xarelto™ is marketed by  a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, were down 
against the prior-year quarter.  
// We posted encouraging sales growth for our ophthalmology drug Eylea™ , mainly driven by higher 
volumes in Europe and Japan as well as a one-time  effect arising from a reimbursement in the United 
Kingdom. 
// Sales of our cancer drug Nubeqa™  rose significantly, with gains in all regions. The product therefore 
maintained its growth momentum, especially in the Un ited States and Europe, wi th strong increases in 
volumes. 
// We also achieved considerable gains for Kerendia™ , our product for the treatment of patients with 
chronic kidney disease associated with  type 2 diabetes, mainly thanks to  a substantial rise in volumes in 
the United States. The expansion of business in Chin a also contributed to th e positive development. 
// The modest decline in sales of ou r long-term contraceptives in the Mirena™  product family was 
attributable to shifts in demand  following a strong prior-year quarter in the United States. 
// Business with our pulmonar y hypertension treatment Adempas™  was up significantly, especially in the 
United States. As in the past, sale s reflected the proportionate recogn ition of the upfront and milestone 
payments resulting from the sGC collabora tion with Merck & Co., United States. 
 
 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of September 30, 2024  9
// Sales of Adalat™ , our product for the treatment of hypertensi on and coronary hear t disease, increased 
against a very weak prior-year quarter, especially in China. 
// The decline in sales of our cancer drug Stivarga™  was primarily due to lower volumes in the United 
States. 
// Our Radiology business continued to benefit from  higher volumes and prices, especially for CT Fluid 
Delivery  and Ultravist™ .

Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  at Pharmaceuticals decreased by 23.4% to €1,102 million in the third quarter 
of 2024 (Q3 2023: €1,438 million), mainly due to a negative curre ncy effect of €134 million (Q3 2023: 
€47 million) and the aforementioned STI effect. Earnings we re also impacted by shifts in the product mix, 
reflecting declines for Xarelto™ and higher sales fo r Nubeqa™ and Eylea™ in particular, along with the 
related increase in license fees. The prior-year period had also benefite d from proceeds from the sale of 
non-core businesses. By contrast, higher investme nts in early-stage research and our cell and gene 
therapy and chemoprote omics technologies were more than offs et by lower expenses for projects in 
advanced clinical development. The EBITDA margin before special items declined by 7.3 percentage 
points to 24.4%. 
EBIT  came in at €768 million in the third quarter of  2024 (Q3 2023: €1,183 m illion) after net special 
charges of €95 million (Q3 2023: € 20 million) that mainly related to  ongoing restructuring projects.

Third quarter of 2024 
Sales 
Sales at Consumer Health increased by 5.7% (Fx & portfolio adj.) to €1 ,413 million in the third quarter of 
2024, with growth across all categories. Positive drivers included higher volumes in Europe/Middle East/Africa and Latin America. However, growth was he ld back by a slower start to the cold season in 
North America compared with the prior year and declining consumer demand in China. 
// Sales in 
Europe/Middle East/Africa  rose sharply, with business up in all categories. We recorded 
significantly higher sales of cough an d cold products at the start of the cold season that were driven by 
increased volumes, especially for the Aspirin™ prod uct family. Sales were also up substantially at 
Dermatology, largely thanks to Bepanthen™. The Diges tive Health category benefited from a normalized 
supply situation, among other factors. 
// Sales in North America  were down in almost all categories. Bu siness was held back particularly by the 
slower start to the cold season mentioned above. In  addition, the Nutritionals  category was impacted by 
the winding down of the Care/of direct-to-consumer nutritional supplements business in mid-2024. By 
contrast, we recorded higher sales in the Digesti ve Health category, main ly driven by gains for 
MiraLAX™ and a positive contribution from Iberogast™ following its second-quarter launch in the United States. 
// Sales in 
Asia/Pacific  came in slightly below the prior-year leve l. A weaker market environment and lower 
volumes in China primarily weighed on Digestive H ealth and Nutritionals, although the latter category 
was able to offset this effect thanks to gains in oth er countries. Sales of alle rgy products were down, 
mainly due to a slower start to the allergy season in Australia compared  with the prior year. By contrast, 
we registered significant gains in the Dermatology category, partly driven by product-line extensions for KangWang™. 
 
 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of September 30, 2024  11
// Sales in Latin America  increased. Business was mainly up in  the Nutritionals and Pain & Cardio 
categories, largely thanks to Redo xon™ and Actron™. We also incr eased sales of cough and cold 
products, partly driven by higher Tabcin™ volumes.

Earnings 
EBITDA before special items  at Consumer Health incr eased by 15.0% to €360 m illion in the third quarter 
of 2024 (Q3 2023: €3 13 million), mainly due to the aforemention ed STI effect and a positive currency effect 
of €7 million (Q3 2023: negative cu rrency effect of €57 millio n). Thanks to our continuous cost and price 
management efforts, we were able to partially offset  an increase in the cost of goods sold and higher 
investments in developing and marketing our products . The EBITDA margin before special items rose by 
3.3 percentage points to 25.5%. 
EBIT  amounted to €222 million in the third quarter of 20 24 (Q3 2023: €213  million) after special charges of

Financial Position of the Bayer Group 
Statement of Cash Flows 
Net cash provided by operating activities 
// Net operating cash flow amounted to €2,111 m illion in the third quar ter of 2024 (Q3 2023: 
€2,576 million), with the y ear-on-year decrease primarily due to qu arterly shifts in the reduction of 
receivables in the Crop Science Division. Payments to resolve proceedings in th e litigations surrounding 
glyphosate, PCBs, EssureTM and dicamba resulted in a net outflow of €189 million (Q3 2023: 
€246 million). 
Net cash provided by investing activities 
// Net investing cash flow stood at €3,758 million  in the third quarter of 2024 (Q3 2023: 
minus €138 million). 
// Net cash inflows from current financial assets tota led €4,215 million (Q3 2023 : €572 million) and were 
largely attributable to the sale of investments in money market funds. 
Net cash used in financing activities 
// There was a net cash outflow of €5,054 million for fi nancing activities in the third quarter of 2024 
(Q3 2023: €160 million).  
// This figure included net debt repayments of €4, 528 million (Q3 2023: net borrowings of €267 million) 
that largely related to the repaymen t of bonds and commercial paper.  
// Net interest payments amounted to  €510 million (Q3 2023: €377 million). 
Free cash flow 
// Free cash flow (total) came in at €1,148 million in the third quarter of 2024  (Q3 2023: €1,626 million), 
largely due to the decrease in operating cash flow. 
Net financial debt 
// Net financial debt of the Bayer Group decreased by  €1.8 billion to €35.0 billion in the third quarter of 
2024 (June 30, 2024: €36.8 billion), ma inly as a result of cash inflo ws from operating activities and 
positive currency effects. 
// Bayer AG placed new hybrid bonds with a volume  of €750 million in Sept ember 2024. The proceeds 
were used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of hybrid bonds in the amount of 
€328 million maturing in 2079 (calla ble on February 12, 2025) before the first call date. In addition, 
bonds with a total volume of €2.9 billion were  repaid in the third quarter of 2024.  
// Furthermore, commercial paper with a nominal volume of €1.8 billion was repaid in the third quarter of 
2024.  
// In October 2024, Bayer US Finance LLC, United  States, redeemed a bond with a volume of 
US$1.75 billion (€1.6 billion) at maturity. 
  
 
 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of September 30, 2024  13
Corporate Outlook 
We confirm our 2024 Group guidance for currency - and portfolio-adjusted sales growth, currency-
adjusted core earnings per share, and free cash flow as published in the 2023 Annual Report. 
However, in view of the weaker-tha n-anticipated development of the agri cultural market, we are revising 
some parts of our Group forecast. We are also making adjustments to our guidance at divisional level: 
While business performance is below our initial expect ations at Crop Science and Consumer Health, we 
now see Pharmaceuticals coming in at th e upper end of our revised guidance.

 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of September 30, 2024  17
Goodwill, other intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment 
Impairment testing was conducted in the Crop Science segment in the third quarter of 2024 due to the 
weaker-than-anticipated development of the agricult ural market environment. This resulted in the 
recognition of impairment losses on  intangible assets totaling €3,777 million. This figure included an 
impairment loss of €3,267 million on goodwill that was due to a deterioration in business prospects overall, especially in crop protection. This effect was partially offset by a decline in the weighted average cost of 
capital. 
Impairment losses were also recognized in the cas h-generating unit Cotton Seed (€510 million, comprising 
€25 million on research and develo pment projects, €411 million on pa tents and technologies, €66 million 
on trademarks and €8 million on market ing and distribution righ ts). The impairment losses for Cotton Seed 
were mainly attributable to un certainty caused by a delayed appr oval process for a complementary 
herbicide for specific applications and the related deterioration in anticipated business prospects. 
The impairment losses on goodwill were recognized in other operating expenses. The impairment losses 
on Cotton Seed assets were allocated to the cost  of goods sold, selling expenses, and research and 
development expenses. The impairment losses refl ected the difference between the respective carrying 
amounts and their fair value less costs of disposal. 
The table below indicates the capital cost factors used in the impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 
2023 and third quarter of 2024. A long-term growth rate of 2% (Q4 2023: 2%) was applied in the testing of goodwill for impairment in the Crop Scien ce segment in the third quarter of 2024.

Legal Risks 
To find out more about the Bayer Group’s legal risks, please see Note [30] to the consolidated financial 
statements in the Bayer Annual Re port 2023, which can be download ed at www.bayer.com. Since the 
Bayer Annual Report 2023, the following significant ch anges have occurred in respect of the legal risks: 
Roundup™ (glyphosate):  A large number of lawsuits from plainti ffs claiming to have been exposed to 
glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer’ s subsidiary Monsanto have been served upon 
Monsanto in the United States. Glyp hosate is the active ingredient co ntained in a number of Monsanto’s 
herbicides, including Roundup™-branded  products. Plaintiffs allege pe rsonal injuries resulting from 
exposure to those products. As of October 15, 2024, Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial number of claims. Of the approximately 177,000 claims in total, approximately 114,000 have been settled or  are not eligible for various reasons. 
As of October 15, 2024, there have been 25 Roundup ™ trials concluded before both federal and state 
courts in California, Missouri, Oregon, Arkansas, Delaware and Pennsylvania. In 15 of those trials, favorable outcomes were achieved on behalf of Mons anto, including 12 defense verdicts, one hung jury 
resulting in a mistrial, one directed verdict on behalf of Monsanto, and one dismissal of plaintiff’s claims 
with prejudice mid-trial. In the other 10 trials, the pl aintiffs were awarded compensatory damages and, in 
most cases, punitive damages. In July 2024, one of the 12 defense verdicts was overturned by the 
appellate court, and a re-trial may be scheduled.  
With regard to the other appeal cases, in August 2024, the Third Circuit Federal Court of Appeals issued 
its ruling in Schaffner, unanimously holding that the state-based failure -to-warn claims in this case are 
expressly preempted by the Federal Insecticide Fungicid e and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). This decision on 
federal preemption creates a circuit split with prio r decisions of the Ninth (Hardeman) and Eleventh 
(Carson) Circuits and may lead to a review by the US Supreme Court to settle this important issue of law. 
Bayer is considering the impact of this ruling on other pending litigation and is going to present its 
arguments, as fully embraced by the Third Circuit, to the US Supr eme Court in due course.     
PCBs:  Bayer’s subsidiary Monsanto has been named in lawsuits brought by various governmental entities 
in the United States claiming th at Monsanto, Pharmacia and Solutia,  collectively as a manufacturer of 
PCBs, should be responsible for a variety of damages due to PCBs in the environment, including bodies of 
water. PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for various purposes until th e manufacture of PCBs was 
prohibited by the EPA in the United States in 1979. In April 2024, the Maine Attorney General filed suit in state court alleging claims for damages related to PCB contamination of the state’ s environment, so that 
there are now six attorney general cases pending. In July 2024, Bayer agreed, without admission of 
liability, to pay US$160 million to settle the lawsuit wi th the City of Seattle, US$35 million of which was 
devoted to PCB remediation. In Se ptember 2024, Bayer agreed, withou t admission of liability, to pay 
US$35 million to settle the lawsuit with the City of Los Angeles. Seattl e and Los Angeles were among the 
municipalities that opted out of th e class settlement reached in 2020. In May 2024, the Court of Appeals 
for the State of Washington handed down its opinion in the first of the Sky Valley Education Center (SVEC) personal injury cases to go to trial (Erickson et al.). The Court of Appeal s reversed the lower-court decision 
and remanded the cases for further pr oceedings, eliminating th e entirety of the comp ensatory and punitive 
damages in that case, based on multiple trial errors . Many of the identified errors should, in Bayer’s 
opinion, carry through the other SVEC trials to date. In October 2024, the Washington Supreme Court accepted review of several issues in this matter.  
BASF arbitration:  In 2019, Bayer was served with a request for arbitration by BASF. BASF alleged 
indemnification claims under asset purchase agr eements signed in 2017 and 2018 related to the 
divestment of certain Crop Science businesses to BASF. In 2022, the arbitral tribunal dismissed BASF’s claims in their entirety. In April 2023, the Higher Re gional Court of Frankfurt am Main (Germany) rejected 
BASF’s motion to set aside the award. However, the court found that the arbitr al award was technically 
invalid because it did not comply with a German proced ural rule regarding the si gnatures of the tribunal 
members. According to the court decision, the original arbitration proceedings had not yet come to an end 
and still had to be concluded by a valid arbitration awar d that fully complies with the procedural rules. In 
July 2024, the Federal Court of Justice overturned the decision of the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt 
 
 Bayer Quarterly Statement as of September 30, 2024  19
am Main and remanded the case back to the Higher Re gional Court for a decision on the alleged grounds 
for annulment, ruling that the procedural rule regarding the signatures of the tribunal members had not been infringed. 
Mine permit Idaho:  In 2019, the United States Bureau of La nd Management (BLM) granted a permit to 
Bayer’s subsidiary P4 Production, LLC, for a new phosphate mine in Idaho. In 2021, three non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) challenged the permit in the United  States District Court for the District 
of Idaho. In June 2023, the court vacated the permit . Bayer has prepared a new mine permit application. 
In September 2024, we reached a settl ement with the plaintiffs. The sett lement ensures that the NGOs will 
not challenge a new permit, which we current ly expect the BLM to issue in summer 2025.  
Shareholder litigation concer ning Monsanto acquisition:  In Germany and the Unit ed States, investors 
have filed lawsuits claiming damages suffered due to the drop in the company’s share price. Plaintiffs 
allege that the company’s capital market communicat ion in connection with the acquisition of Monsanto 
was flawed. In the German proceedings, approximately 280 plaintiffs have withdrawn their claims. As of 
October 15, 2024, there were approximately 60 pl aintiffs with claims pending in Germany.
