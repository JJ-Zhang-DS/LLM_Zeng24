Since the inception of the theory and conceptual framework of genomic selection (GS),
extensive research has been done on evaluating its ef ﬁciency for utilization in crop
improvement. Though, the marker-assisted selection has proven its potential forimprovement of qualitative traits controlled by one to few genes with large effects. Itsrole in improving quantitative traits controlled by several genes with small effects is limited.In this regard, GS that utilizes genomic-estimated breeding values of individuals obtainedfrom genome-wide markers to choose candidates for the next breeding cycle is a powerfulapproach to improve quantitative traits. In the last two decades, GS has been widelyadopted in animal breeding programs globally because of its potential to improve selectionaccuracy, minimize phenotyping, reduce cycle time, and increase genetic gains. Inaddition, given the promising initial evaluation outcomes of GS for the improvement ofyield, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and quality in cereal crops like wheat, maize, andrice, prospects of integrating it in breeding crops are also being explored. Improvedstatistical models that leverage the genomic information to increase the predictionaccuracies are critical for the effectiveness of GS-enabled breeding programs. Studyon genetic architecture under drought and heat stress helps in developing productionmarkers that can signi ﬁcantly accelerate the development of stress-resilient crop varieties
through GS. This review focuses on the transition from traditional selection methods to GS,underlying statistical methods and tools used for this purpose, current status of GS studies
in crop plants, and perspectives for its successful implementation in the development of
climate-resilient crops.

sound. It has been projected that production has to be increased
by 60% by 2050, amid different challenges related to theproduction system posed by climate change ( WHO/FAO,
2015 ), which is further projected to worsen by an increase in
the price of food to the extent of 1 –29% by 2050. The
development of climate-resilient varieties through conventionalapproaches of hybridization and selection is input-intensive(labor, land, and time), limiting the realized genetic gain.Improvement in the genetic gain as per the Lush equation(Lush, 1943 ) can be secured through i) better intensity of
selection viaaccurate and high-throughput phenotyping and
ii) having a broad genetic base representing diverse eco-geography in breeding program. The advancement ingenomics approaches leads to the availability of huge resourceslike genome sequence information, transcriptome, and proteome
that have paved the way to hasten the identi ﬁcation of target
genes mitigating the effects of climate change ( Varshney et al.,
2018 ). This sequence of information also leads to the
identi ﬁcation of several mutant loci at the nucleotide level
which might be associated with characters of complex naturelike yield in general and under different circumstances of stress,which are otherwise very dif ﬁcult to decipher. Genomic selection
emerged as an important tool which can utilize such informationfor modeling the crop yield for effective and rapid selection underdifferent environmental conditions to meet the productionchallenges in a climate-changing world.
Changes brought about by climate change have affected the
phenology of different crop species leading to a detrimental effecton production and productivity. Different stresses, viz., heat, cold,drought, and ﬂood, are speci ﬁc manifestations of climate change.
Genetic improvement of crops based on phenotypic selection hasbeen successfully achieved through traditional breeding.However, in recent past, genomics led to the identi ﬁcation of
several underlying genes/QTLs providing tolerance to thesespeciﬁc conditions, which have been utilized in marker-
assisted selection (MAS). MAS is an indirect selection process,where individuals for a particular trait of interest are selected
based on the known markers linked to it ( Fernando and
Grossman, 1989 ). This method has been ef ﬁciently used in the
past for selection of individuals in plant breeding to increase theselection accuracy compared to the traditional phenotype-basedselection process ( Mohan et al., 1997 ). In cereals, MAS resulted in
a number of varieties, viz., Improved Pusa Basmati1(Gopalakrishnan et al., 2008 ), Pusa Basmati 1728 ( Singh et al.,
2017a ), Pusa Basmati 1637 ( Singh et al., 2017b ), Pusa Samba 1850
(Krishnan et al., 2019 ), Improved Samba Mahsuri ( Madhavi et al.,
2016 ), and Swarna-Sub1 ( Neeraja et al., 2007 ) in rice, HUW510 in
wheat ( Vasistha et al., 2017 ), and HHB67-Improved in pearl
millet ( Rai et al., 2008 ). C214 in chickpea ( Varshney et al., 2014a ),
JTN5503 and DS880 in soybean ( Arelli et al., 2006 ,2009 ), and
JL24 and TAG24 in groundnut ( Varshney et al., 2014b ) have been
derived using MAS. However, MAS is practically feasible only ifthe trait of interest is associated with one or very few major genes,and it is impractical or irrelevant for quantitative traits(i.e., polygenic traits that are governed by few hundreds ofminor genes) ( Bernardo, 2008 ), which most of the stress
tolerance –related traits are based on. To overcome this issue, anew selection tool called genomic selection (GS) was proposed
that can facilitate selection for such traits, by means of net geneticmerit of an individual obtained using the effects of dense markersdistributed across the genome ( Meuwissen et al., 2001 ). In this
approach, the individual effect of each marker is estimated, andthe additive sum of all the marker effects is used for calculation ofthe genomic-estimated breeding values (GEBV) of each
individual. In the current scenario of climate change, GS is a
promising tool for improving the genetic gain of individualsunder the breeding program ( Yuan et al., 2019 ). The basic process
of any genomic selection process starts with the creation oftraining population, i.e., individuals having both genotypic andphenotypic information, and this information is used to build amodel, where the phenotype is used as a response and genotype asa predictor. The information from the developed model is laterused to estimate the GEBV of breeding population,i.e., individuals having only genotypic information. The basicprocess of GS is also explained in Figure 1 .
The major advantage of using GS is that it allows for a drastic
reduction in the duration of the breeding cycle as compared totraditional breeding and also minimizes the cost associated withextensive phenotyping, thereby subsequently accelerating geneticgains and ensuring food and nutritional security ( Heffner et al.,
2010 ). However, there are certain factors such as the size of
training and breeding populations, genetic diversity of breedingpopulation, heritability of the underlying trait, in ﬂuence of
genotype –environment (GxE) interaction, density of markers,
and genetic relationship between training population andbreeding population or selection candidates, which may
inﬂuence the genomic prediction ’s accuracy ( De Roos et al.,
2009 ;Lorenzana and Bernardo, 2009 ;Luan et al., 2009 ;
Daetwyler et al., 2010 ;Clark et al., 2011 ;Howard et al., 2014 ).
Hence, successful implementation of GS in breeding programsrequires careful consideration of all these factors. Apart fromthese factors, there are certain limitations of genomic selection.Changes in gene frequencies and epistatic interactions drasticallyaffect the estimates of GEBV. Most of the models used to estimateGEBV ignore the effect of epistasis which plays a prime role
FIGURE 1 | Basic schema of the genomic selection process.
Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832153 2Budhlakoti et al. A Comprehensive Review on Genomic Selection
especially in cross pollinated plants ( Heffner et al., 2009 ). The rate
of declination of selection response is more in GS than pedigreebased selection, which can be minimized through the addition ofnew markers to the model ( Nakaya and Isobe, 2012 ). However,
the cost of implementation of GS is more than that of the
traditional breeding program.
The choice of models is an important factor in implementing
GS, and several parametric and non-parametric genomicprediction models are available for this purpose. One of themost common and widely used parametric genomic selectionmodel is the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP). It is amixed model –based whole-genome regression approach that is
used to estimate the marker effects, and the same has beensuccessfully applied to predict complex traits ( Habier et al.,
2009 ,2013 ;de los Campos et al., 2013 ). In general, it was
observed that the performance of parametric models found to be
efﬁcient only for traits with additive genetic architectures. For
traits that are highly affected by epistatic or non-additive
interactions, it becomes challenging to use parametric models(Moore and Williams, 2009 ). Epistatic interactions play a key
role in explaining genetic variation for quantitative traits.Hence, ignoring such type of information in the predictionmodel might result in lower genomic prediction accuracies(Cooper et al., 2002 ). Due to these factors, it is not always
advisable to practice simple linear or parametric models.Gianola et al. (2006) ﬁrst used non-parametric and
semiparametric methods for modeling the complex genetic
architecture. Subsequently, se veral statistical methods were
implemented to model both additive and epistatic effects forgenomic selection ( Xu, 2007 ;Cai et al., 2011 ). For a detailed
comparison of various parametric, non-parametric andsemiparametric methods in different settings of populationsize and trait heritability, one can refer to Howard et al.
(2014) and Budhlakoti et al. (2020c) . Recently, some
semiparametric ( Legarra and Reverter, 2018 ) and advanced
approaches ( Tanaka, 2018 ;Budhlakoti et al., 2020a ,2020b ;
Majumdar et al., 2020 ;Sehgal et al., 2020 ;Tanaka, 2020 ;
Mishra et al., 2021 ) have also been proposed and
implemented in context to genomic selection. In the nextsection, few most commonly used methods for genomicselection studies have been discussed.
STATISTICAL MODEL FOR GENOMIC
SELECTION
The process of selecting the suitable individuals in GS starts with a
simple linear model sometimes also called least-squaresregression or ordinary least-squares regression (OLS):
Y/equals1
nµ+Xβ+ε
where Y/equalsn× 1 vectors of observations, µ is the mean, β/equalsp×1
vectors of marker effects, ε/equalsn× 1 vectors of random residual
effects, X= design matrix of order n×p(where each row
represents the genotype/individuals/lines (n) and each columncorresponds to the marker (p)), and ε/tildewideN(0,σ
2
e).One major problem in linear models using several thousands
of genome-wide markers is that the number of markers (p)exceeds the number of observations (n), i.e., genotype/individuals/lines, and this creates the problem of over-
parameterization (large “p”and small “n”problem (p >>n)).
Using a subset of signi ﬁcant markers can be an alternative for
dealing with the large “p”and small “n”problem. Meuwissen et al.
(2001) used a modi ﬁcation of the least-squares regression for GS.
They performed least-squares regression analysis on each markerseparately with the following model:
Y/equalsX
jβj+ε
where Xj/equalsjthcolumn of the design matrix of the markers and βj
= genetic effect of the jthmarker.
Markers with signi ﬁcant effects are selected using the log
likelihood of this model, and those are further used forestimation of breeding values. However, it has to be noted thatsome key information may be lost by selection based on the subsetof markers.
Hence, an ef ﬁcient solution for the over-parameterization
problem in linear models is using ridge regression (RR), which
is a penalized regression –based approach ( Meuwissen et al.,
2001 ). It also solves the problems of multicollinearity at the
same time (i.e., correlated predictors, e.g., SNP, or markers).RR shrinks the coef ﬁcients of correlated predictors equally
toward zero and solves the regression problem using ℓ2
penalized least squares. Here, the goal is to derive an estimatorof parameter βwith a smaller variance than the least-squares
estimator. Similar to RR, the least absolute shrinkage andselection operator (LASSO) ( Tibshirani, 1996 ;Usai et al.,
2009 ) is another variant of penalized regression, which uses
the ℓ
1penalized least-squares criterion to obtain a sparse
solution. However, sometimes LASSO may not work well withhighly correlated predictors (e.g., SNPs in high linkagedisequilibrium) ( Ogutu et al., 2012 ). The elastic net (ENET) is
an extension of the LASSO that is robust to extreme correlationsamong the predictors ( Friedman et al., 2010 ), and it is a
compromise between ℓ1 penalty (LASSO) and ℓ2 penalty (RR)
(Zou and Hastie, 2005 ).
The RR model considers that each marker contributes to equal
variance, which is not the case for all traits. Therefore, thevariance of the markers based on the trait ’s genetic
architecture has to be modeled. For this purpose, several
Bayesian models have been proposed where it is assumed thatthere is some prior distribution of marker effects. Furthermore,inferences about model parameters are obtained on the basis ofposterior distributions of marker effects. There are severalvariants of Bayesian models for genomic prediction such asBayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C π, and Bayes D π(Meuwissen et al.,
2001 ;Habier et al., 2011 ) and other derivatives, e.g., Bayesian
LASSO and Bayesian ridge regression (BRR). Besides the marker-based models, the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP)(Henderson et al., 1959 ) is one of the most commonly used
genomic prediction methods. There are many variants of BLUP
available for this purpose, e.g., genomic BLUP (GBLUP), single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP), ridge regression BLUP (RRBLUP), and
Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832153 3Budhlakoti et al. A Comprehensive Review on Genomic Selection
GBLUP with linear ridge kernel regression (rrGBLUP), of which
GBLUP is very frequently used. The GBLUP uses the genomicrelationships calculated using markers instead of theconventional BLUP which uses the pedigree relationships toobtain the GEBV of the lines or individuals ( Meuwissen et al.,
2001 ).
The genomic prediction models discussed so far perform well
for traits with additive genetic architecture, but their performance
becomes very poor in case of epistatic genetic architectures.Hence, Gianola et al. (2006) ﬁrst used non-parametric and
semiparametric methods for modeling the complex geneticarchitecture. Subsequently, several statistical methods wereimplemented to model both additive and epistatic effects forgenomic selection ( Xu, 2007 ;Cai et al., 2011 ;Legarra and
Reverter, 2018 ). There are several non-parametric methods
that have been studied in relation to genomic selection, e.g.,NW (Nadaraya –Watson) estimator ( Gianola et al., 2006 ), RKHS
(reproductive kernel Hilbert space) ( Gianola et al., 2006 ), SVM
(support vector machine) ( Maenhout et al., 2007 ;Long et al.,
2011 ), ANN (arti ﬁcial neural network) ( Gianola et al., 2011 ), and
RF (random forest) ( Holliday et al., 2012 ), among them SVM,
NN, and RF are based on the machine learning approach.
Methods discussed earlier in this section are based on genomic
information where information is available for a single trait,i.e., single-trait genomic selection (STGS). As the performanceof STGS-based methods may be affected signi ﬁcantly in case of
pleiotropy, i.e., one gene linked to multiple traits, a mutation in apleiotropic gene may have an effect on several traitssimultaneously. It was observed that low heritability traits can
borrow information from correlated traits and consequently
achieve higher prediction accuracy. However, STGS-basedmethods consider the information of each trait independently.Hence, we may lose crucial information which may ultimatelyresult in poor genomic prediction accuracy. Nowadays, as we arereceiving data on multiple traits, so multi-trait genomic selection(MTGS)-based methods may provide more accurate GEBV andsubsequently a higher prediction accuracy. Several MTGS-basedmethods have been studied in relation to GS, e.g., multivariatemixed model approach ( Jia and Jannink, 2012 ;Kláp štěet al.,
2020 ), Bayesian multi-trait model ( Jia and Jannink, 2012 ;Cheng
et al., 2018 ), MRCE (multivariate regression with covariance
estimation) ( Rothman et al., 2010 ), and cGGM (conditional
Gaussian graphical model) ( Chiquet et al., 2017 ).Jia and
Jannink (2012) presented three multivariate linear models
(i.e., GBLUP, Bayes A, and Bayes C π) and compared them to
univariate models, and a detailed comparison of various STGS-
and MTGS-based methods has also been studied by Budhlakoti
et al. (2019c) . A brief structure of different STGS- and MTGS-
based methods used in GS studies is given in Figure 2 .
GS: IMPLICATIONS IN CROP
IMPROVEMENT
GS in Cereals
Cereals are an important part of our daily diet as they contribute
about 50% of the total dietary energy supply ( WHO/FAO, 2003 ).
Wheat, rice, maize, and barley are the major cereal crops, whichare being grown on arable land all over the world amounting to atotal of 2,817 million tonnes of production (FAO). Production ofthese crops is being challenged by calamities created by a changein climatic pattern ( Reynolds, 2010 ), and over that, it is being
complicated by the rising demand of increasing population(Tester and Langridge, 2010 ;Furbank and Tester, 2011 ). To
meet the challenges, the production system has to be ef ﬁcient
and sustainable with lower pressure on the ecosystem. High-yielding, resource-ef ﬁcient crop varieties are an integral
component of such production systems which can address the
challenges. But the development of such variety is a painstakingendeavor as most of the crop productivity traits are under thecontrol of a complex genetic system (most genes are of minoreffect) with the complication of low heritability and high order ofepitasis ( Mackay, 2001 ). Though conventional selection methods
have resulted in a number of varieties but the genetic gain per unittime is not as much rewarding as GS, it provides an opportunityto hasten the cycle of selection ( Bernardo and Yu, 2007 ;Lorenz
FIGURE 2 | Overall summary of the most commonly used models in genomic selection.
Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832153 4Budhlakoti et al. A Comprehensive Review on Genomic Selection
et al., 2011 ). The potential of GS can be assessed from the fact that
it has the ability to select high breeding value individuals rapidlyfrom early-generation populations without the need of extensivephenotyping. This has been shown effectively in cereal crops in
the recent past. Wheat, rice, maize, and barley are the ﬁrst
candidate crops where the effectiveness of GS has beenstudied. GS in these crops leads to the identi ﬁcation of
different models which were able to ef ﬁciently predict the
performance of traits under question and ﬁlter out the
important breeding material. In the following section, the roleof GS in cereal crops has been discussed.
Grain Yield and Related Traits ’Improvement
Grain yield is a major trait which is affected directly or indirectly
by other traits including thousand grain weight, number of tillers
bearing panicle, number of grains per panicle, number of ﬁlled
grains per panicle etc. Genomic prediction for these traitsutilizing different types of training populations and modelshave been evaluated. The variations in the accuracies ofgenomic prediction have been attributed to the heritability ofthe trait, training population, and models used. The genomicprediction accuracy for a very complex and physiologicaltrait –like distribution of weight to the individual grain in the
panicle in rice ( Yabe et al., 2018 ) ranged from 0.28 to 0.78 for
grain yield in maize ( Rio et al., 2019 ). For the improvement of
accuracy, the role of training population also has a signi ﬁcant
effect, and it has been reported that prediction based on the
training set developed using North Carolina mating design II(0.60) was found at par with that of full diallel matings (0.58) andsuperior to that of test cross (0.10) ( Fristche-Neto et al., 2018 ).
Similarly, better prediction accuracies for grain yield wereobserved in recombinant inbred lines and doubled haploidpopulations compared to natural populations ( Liu et al., 2018 ).
The accuracy of GS for grain yield is also highly in ﬂuenced by the
size of training populations and genetic relationships between thetraining and breeding populations ( Lozada et al., 2019 ;Lozada
and Carter, 2020 ).Longin et al. (2014) reported that GS followed
by one cycle of phenotypic selection has been reported to facilitate
identi ﬁcation of superior parental lines with better combining
ability and high annual genetic gain for grain yield in wheat thansimple phenotypic selection. However scheme had notconsidered the cost and time involved in production andnursery screening of these lines, and thus, additional schemeslike GSrapid have been proposed which have better selection gainand have been recommended for utilization in a hybrid breedingprogram of different cereal crops ( Marulanda et al., 2016 ). GS
could also be potentially used in the prediction of theperformance of a large number of hybrid combinations
(VanRaden, 2008 ;Crossa et al., 2017 ). The earlier GS studies
on cereals started with wheat where the DArT marker system wasused ( Crossa et al., 2010 ,2011 ;Heffner et al., 2011 ;Burgueño
et al., 2012 ;Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2012 ). However, later, other
genome-wide SNP platforms became the routine marker ingenomic selection owing to their own advantages ( Poland
et al., 2012 ;Zhao et al., 2012 ). Detailed information on GS
studies for grain yield and related traits in major cereals,pulses, oilseeds, and horticultural crops with the details ofstatistical models, marker platforms, types of populations used,
and the prediction accuracies of statistical models are listed inTable 1 .
Biotic Stress Tolerance
With the change in weather patterns, emergence/resurgence of
new races and biotypes of pathogens and insects is being reportedglobally ( Juarez et al., 2013 ;Váry et al., 2015 ;Fones et al., 2020 ).
Hence, identi ﬁcation of resistance genes in the germplasm and
their incorporation into the breeding program are required todevelop biotic stress –tolerant varieties. MAS has proved to be
efﬁcient in breeding for qualitative resistance, but for quantitative
resistance which is governed by many genes with smaller effects,MAS has not been so effective. GS has proved its role inimproving tolerance against biotic stresses in cereals which are
quantitatively controlled, though it has been applied to a very
limited extent. Most of the studies on the utility of GS for bioticstress tolerance have been reported from wheat, for a wide arrayof diseases including three types of rusts, Fusarium head blight,
septoria tritici blotch, powdery mildew, tan spot, andStagonospora nodorum blotch. The genomic prediction
accuracies for these diseases ranged from 0.14 to 0.85(Rutkoski et al., 2012 ;Daetwyler et al., 2014 ;Mirdita et al.,
2015 ;Juliana et al., 2017 ;Sarinelli et al., 2019 ). In rice, GS has
been utilized to identify blast-tolerant lines ( Huang et al., 2019 ).
In maize, GS has been successfully utilized to select lines from
natural populations for tolerance to Stenocarpella maydis causing
ear rot ( dos Santos et al., 2016 ) and from biparental populations
for superior yield under heavy infestation of Striga (Badu-Apraku
et al., 2019 ). In case of barley, markers and prediction models
were utilized for Fusarium head blight severity, and the
prediction accuracy was quite higher, i.e., 0.72, than that ofconventional phenotyping ( Lorenz et al., 2012 ;Sallam and
Smith, 2016 ).
Abiotic Stress Tolerance
The occurrence of drought, high-temperature stress during crop
growth stages, ﬂood, etc., is at surge due to climate change,
causing signi ﬁcant crop losses ( Qin et al., 2011 ). With the 1°C
increase in global temperature, yield reduction has been predictedup to 6.4% in wheat ( Liu et al., 2016 ). The sustainable and
economic options under such situations to cover the losses arechanging cropping patterns or developing abiotic stress –tolerant
varieties. Identi ﬁcation of tolerant genotypes from the germplasm
and their utilization in the breeding program become a primerequirement for development of such varieties ( Baenziger, 2016 ).
The major issue in breeding for abiotic stress tolerance is theircomplex inheritance, low heritability, and high environmental
effect on them ( Bernardo, 2008 ).
Conventional breeding methods for abiotic stresses suffer
from limitations of accuracy and reproducibility. Thoughmolecular markers have been utilized to identify and transferyield QTLs under abiotic stress conditions ( Ribaut and Ragot,
2007 ;Almeida et al., 2013 ), but it may not be effective as QTL
from limited genetic resources explain little variation for grainyield under stress and are also highly in ﬂuenced by the genetic
background ( Semagn et al., 2013 ) as well as the environment and

there interactions. GS is superior to MAS, and the prediction
efﬁciency is also higher for abiotic stress tolerance ( Cerrudo et al.,
2018 ). The usefulness of GS has been shown in wheat, maize, and
rice for drought and heat tolerance.
Beyene et al. (2015) have reported a gain of 0.086 t/ha for grain
yield, following the rapid cycling GS strategy in eight biparentalpopulations of maize under drought conditions, and a ﬁnal gain
of 0.176 t/ha after three cycles of selection. This increased thegenetic gain as the time required for selection was reducedsigniﬁcantly as compared to that of the conventional breeding
scheme, where it was three times higher with phenotypicselection. Similarly, Das et al. (2020) reported a genetic gain of
0.110 and 0.135 t/ha/yr for grain yield under drought and 0.038and 0.113 t/ha/yr under water logging in two maize populations,viz., Maize Yellow Synthetic 1 and Maize Yellow Synthetic 2,
respectively, following rapid cycling genomic selection. Vivek
et al. (2017) compared the performances of second cycle selection
through phenotypic and rapid cycle genomic selection and found10–20% superiority using the latter. Genomic prediction
accuracies using multi-environment models for drought stresstolerance were higher than those using single-environmentmodels in rice and wheat ( Sukumaran et al., 2018 ;Bhandari
et al., 2019 ). Prediction accuracies were higher for heat and
drought stress in case of wheat when secondary traitscontributing to yield were considered under stress rather thanyield per se using genomic prediction ( Rutkoski et al., 2016 ).
Comparative analysis among different models leads to the
conclusion that multi-trait models are superior when selectionis carried out in severe drought conditions, while the randomregression model was better than the repeatability model andmulti-trait model under normal drought conditions and also useof secondary high-throughput traits in genomic predictionimproved accuracies by ~70% ( Sun et al., 2017 ).
Quality Improvement
Quality traits have varied genetic architectures, some being
controlled oligogenically like grain color, while others are
polygenic in nature, viz., grain size and protein content
(Batten ﬁeld et al., 2016 ). GS has been carried out in wheat
extensively for quality-related traits, viz., milling and ﬂour
quality, and when prediction accuracies were compared inbiparental and multi-family populations, it was concluded thatthe prediction accuracies in multi-family populations were better(Heffner et al., 2011 ).
Protein content is known to be negatively correlated with yield
due to physiological compensation ( Lam et al., 1996 ).Michel et al.
(2019) employed multi-trait genomic selection for grain yield,
protein content, and dough rheological traits for ef ﬁcient
selection with optimized yield and protein content with better
quality. The prediction accuracy for the quality traits depends onvariability in the germplasm, the relationship among training andprediction populations, etc. ( Crossa et al., 2014 ;Zhao et al., 2015 ).
Joukhadar et al. (2021) used Bayesian regression and BRR for
rapid improvement of grain yield as well as mineral content tobiofortify wheat and reported Bayesian regression was better inpredicting mineral content with an accuracy of 0.55. In rice, grainlength and width are important quality parameters, and theTABLE 1 | (Continued ) Genomic prediction for grain yield and related traits in different crops (i.e. Cereals, Pulses, Oilseeds and Horticultural crops).

prediction accuracy for these traits ranged from 0.35 to 0.45 and
0.5 to 0.7, respectively, in 110 Japanese rice cultivars employingvarious GS models ( Onogi et al., 2015 ). In barley, the prediction
for quality traits like malting quality (prediction accuracy:
0.4–0.8) has shown the prospects of GS for screening large
populations without the need of cost-intensive phenotyping(Schmidt et al., 2016 ).
GS in Oilseeds
Oilseeds are a source of livelihood to the smallholder farmers in
developing countries of Asia and Africa. The yield potential is stillto be realized by bridging the yield gap viainducing tolerance to
biotic and abiotic stresses and improvement in quality ( Janila
et al., 2016 ). Different traits related to biotic and abiotic stresses
have been mapped, but most of them are qualitative in nature,
and the report of GS is limited in such potential crops. Oil quality
and yield traits are in ﬂuenced by the environment and GxE
interactions ( Patil et al., 2020 ). Hence, it is important to use the
appropriate GS models to account for the GxE effects for accurateselection. Pandey et al. (2020) employed GS in groundnut with
different models and validation schemes to account for GxEinteraction effects. The model having genomic informationgenerated from the SNP (G), genotypic effect of the line (L),environment effect (E), and their interactions (LxE and GxE) hadbetter mean accuracy (0.58) for all the traits compared to othermodels. Jan et al. (2016) employed the RRBLUP model for GS in
Brassica using 950 cross combinations derived from utilizing 475
lines and two testers, for the improvement of oil-speci ﬁc traits,
and the accuracy for oil content and oil yield was 0.81 and 0.75,respectively. Hence, they concluded that the GS model is helpfulin pre-selecting superior cross combinations before extensiveﬁeld evaluation over location and years saving resources.
Fikere et al. (2020) employed GS for 22 traits related to yield,
disease resistance, and quality in B. napus and reported prediction
accuracy was highest for yield (0.69) followed by oil content(0.64) using GBLUP. They also evaluated genomic prediction forcompositional fatty acid estimated under rainfed and irrigated
conditions and concluded that the prediction accuracies for these
traits were lower under non-irrigated conditions. Xiong et al.
(2020) employed various prediction models, viz., LASSO,
GBLUP, OLS, and OLS post-LASSO, for different traits in B.
napus and reported the two-stage method OLS post-LASSO to be
the most accurate (0.90 and 0.55 for oil content and single plantyield, respectively) with the provision of incorporating GxEinteractions. For oil content in sun ﬂower which is highly
heritable and additive in nature, Mangin et al. (2017) reported
that accuracy based on general combining ability (GCA) and GSwere on par, and in case if there is no knowledge about one of the
parents of hybrid combination, GS excels the GCA-based
predictions. Similar inferences had been made by Reif et al.
(2013) for the prediction of hybrid performance in sun ﬂower.
From a cross between cultivated and wild progenitors of
soybean ( G. max XG. sojae ),Beche et al. (2021) reported that
the yield-related alleles were ass ociated with the cultivated elite
line, but the protein content alleles were from the wildprogenitor. The difference in the distribution of trait-c o n t r i b u t i n ga l l e l e si ns u c hc r o s s e sh a sag r e a t e ri m p a c to ntheir predictive accuracy. When each allele is distributed equally
in the population, the predictive accuracy for both the alleles isthe same. In such cases, it is obvious that the less frequent allele ’s
prediction is biased downward. Contiguous breeding programs
are very common where new cross combinations are added each
year. In such cases, using nested association mapping (NAM)population is better in terms of prediction accuracy (for yield0.68 and oil and for protein c ontent 0.76) than biparental
population, showing the potential of NAM whereconnectedness is there among the population on the basis ofthe common parent ( Beche et al., 2021 ). Similarly, Stewart-
Brown et al. (2019) have reported that, for better predictions in
soybean, it is important to have good relatedness amongtraining and breeding populations. They have observed thatthe size of the training population has a larger effect on the
prediction accuracy, compared to the marker density, but
increasing the training population sizes beyond a limit had adiminishing return on the prediction accuracy. Hu et al. (2011)
applied GS for biological process, i.e., embryogenesis capacity insoybean, and reported a good pr ediction accuracy (0.78).
GS in Pulses
In lentil, Haile et al. (2020) showed that if large-effect QTLs were
present in the population, multi-trait –based Bayes B is the best
GS model, while single-trait GS (STGS) is suitable in theirabsence. They also reported that, for low heritable traits with
GxE interactions, MTGS improves predictability. Considering
quality traits in Phaseolus , i.e., cooking time for screening of fast
culinary genotypes, Diaz et al. (2021) evaluated GS using different
populations (RIL, MAGIC, Andean, and Mesoamerican breedinglines). The trait was highly heritable (0.64 –0.89), and genomic
prediction accuracies for cooking time using MAGIC populationwere promising and high (0.55) compared to those ofMesoamerican genotypes (0.22).
Under the circumstance of less connectedness in the training
and prediction populations, mar kers generated using the whole
genome re-sequencing (WGRS) platform increase the
prediction accuracy; however, Li et al. (2018) proposed ﬁrst
identifying causal variants and then utilizing them into theprediction. The prediction accuracy was 0.148 –0.186 for yield
under drought when using all the SNP from WGRS, but when
ﬁltered yield-related causal SNPs were employed, it was
observed that prediction accuracy signi ﬁcantly improved
(0.56 –0.61). Diaz et al. (2021) employed GS for root rot
resistance and reported high prediction accuracies (0.7 –0.8)
for both rots ( Pythium and Fusarium )i n Phaseolus and
proposed it to be promising for improving quantitativetolerance.
GS in Horticultural Crops
Fruit and vegetables are indispensable in achieving nutritionalsecurity. However, the problem associated with their breeding,especially of fruits, has its own limitations, viz., long juvenilephase and highly heterozygous nature. Therefore, genetic gain isnot much as per the Lush equation. In such crops, GS can be aperfect tool where prediction of performance for quality- andyield-related traits which are under a complex genetic system can
Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832153 9Budhlakoti et al. A Comprehensive Review on Genomic Selection
be utilized to improve selection accuracy and ef ﬁciency in
developing varieties. The success of GS in annual crops hasled the horticultural crop breeder to utilize its potential inperennial fruit as well as annual fruit and vegetable crops.
Roth et al. (2020) evaluated 537 genotypes in apple for fruit
texture traits and performed GS and reported the accuracy up to0.81. It was suggested to have a large training population fromwhich a tailored training population with a priori geneticrelatedness information and ample variation can be formedand utilized to predict the performance of population underconsideration. Kumar et al. (2012) have shown high prediction
accuracy in apple for different quality traits utilizing a factorialmating design (0.70 –0.90). Imai et al. (2019) reported that
ssGBLUP predicts with higher accuracy (0.650, 0.519, and0.666) than GBLUP (0.642, 0.432, and 0.655) for quality traits
in citrus, viz., fruit weight, sugar content, and acid content from
population where some individuals are not genotyped usinginformation from genotyped related individuals, hencereducing the cost at hand.
A sf r u i t sa r ep e r i s h a b l ep r o d u c ea n dt h ep o s t - h a r v e s t
attribute of the fruits plays an important role in storability,attempts have been made to employ GS for such traits. Inapricot, Nsibi et al. (2020) reported prediction accuracy
ranging from 0.31 to 0.78 for glucose content and ethyleneproduction. Minamikawa et al. (2017) compared different
models of GS for fruit weight distribution among two groups
of fruit sizes and reported that, among a large fruit size group,
rrGBLUP (0.89) was superior to GBLUP (0.74) and the samewas in the case of a small fruit size group, i.e., rrGBLUP (0.32)and GBLUP (0.30). Also, it was proposed to have breedingpopulation or combined parental and breeding population astraining population to have better accuracy than only havingparental as training population which was consistent for all thequality-related traits. Kumar et al. (2019) employed GS in pear
for various fruit quality traits ranging from texture to taste andobserved the prediction accuracy ranged from 0.32 to 0.62averaging to 0.42 and also suggested that training population
should be multi-generational and evaluated rigorously over
location and time, to have better prediction accuracy.Various GS models have been evaluated for different fruit-related traits in capsicum and reported that RKHS had betteraccuracy ranging from 0.75 to 0.82 and positively correlatedwith the number of markers ( Hong et al., 2020 ). GS is also
performed to evaluate the accuracy of prediction of differentbiochemical parameters important for fruit quality in tomatowhich ranged from 0.13 to 0.70 for aspartate content and alsofor other traits, viz., fruit weight (0.81), ﬁrmness (0.61), soluble
solids (0.71), sugar content (0.65), and acidity (0.62) ( Duangjit
et al., 2016 ).
STATISTICAL TOOLS FOR IMPLEMENTING
GENOMIC SELECTION
Several tools and packages have been developed for the evaluation
of genomic prediction and implementation of GS, some of whichare discussed below.GMStool
It is a genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based tool forgenomic prediction using genome-wide marker data. It searchesfor the optimum number of markers for prediction using
appropriate statistical and machine learning/deep
learning –based models and chooses the best prediction model
(Jeong et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, it identi ﬁes SNP markers with
the lowest p-values (e.g., top 100 markers) in the GWAS and then
chooses the relevant markers set to be included in the ﬁnal
prediction model. GMStool is R-based and freely availablethrough the GitHub repository at https://github.com/JaeYoonKim72/GMStool. The whole process or its algorithm isbasically divided into three steps: data preparation, markerselection, and ﬁnal prediction model. The detailed procedure
of GMStool is discussed below.
Step 1: Input data are divided into training and test sets (user
deﬁned)
Step 2: The training set is further divided into small datasets
for performing cross validation (i.e., k-folds, for example, ﬁve or
ten folds) followed by marker selection in each group or fold. Theprocess of marker selection is performed in each fold/groupsimultaneously.
Step 3: The selected marker from each fold is integrated into
theﬁnal marker set for updating the model. Appropriate
statistical and machine learning –based models are then used
for genomic prediction.
solGS
It is an open-source tool based on the Linux operating system.The work ﬂow of the tool is broadly divided into two steps,
i.e., training of the prediction model and obtaining GEBV.However, there are three approaches available for training theprediction model, i.e., trait-based approach, trial approach, andcustom lists approach. Here, model input and output could bevisualized graphically and can be interactively explored ordownloaded. It is designed to store a large amount ofgenotypic, phenotypic, and experimental data. In thebackground, it basically uses two R-based packages, i.e., nlme
(Pinheiro et al., 2017 ) for data preprocessing and rrBLUP
(Endelman, 2011 ) for statistical modeling. solGS was earlier
used by the NEXTGEN Cassava project (http://nextgencassava.org) and implemented at the Cassavabase website (http://cassavabase.org/solgs).
rrBLUP
It is an R package based on BLUP, which is a mixed linear modelframework ( Endelman, 2011 ). It is one of the most widely used
packages for genomic prediction in animal and plant breeding.This package estimates the marker effects from training datasets
and ultimately estimates the GEBV for the selection candidates.
The mixed.solve function, a linear mixed model equation which
estimates marker effects and GEBV, is one of the most commonlyused functions of this package. An additive relationship matrix ofindividuals can be calculated using genotypic data for theestimation of GEBV using GBLUP. rrBLUP is an open-sourcepackage and can be accessed at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rrBLUP.
Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 832153 10Budhlakoti et al. A Comprehensive Review on Genomic Selection
BWGS
It is an integrated pipeline based on R and freely available at
https://CRAN.R-project.or g/package=BWGS. The BWGS
(i.e., BreedWheat Genomic Selection) pipeline ( Charmet
et al., 2020 ) basically consists of three modules: i) missing
data imputation, ii) dimension reduction, i.e., reducing thenumber of markers as it could enhance the speed ofcomputation on large datasets, and iii) estimation of GEBV.It has a wide choice of totally 15 parametric and non-parametric statistical models for estimation of GEBV forselection candidates. It could be used for estimation ofGEBV for a wide range of genetic architectures. This toolcomprises mainly two functions: bwgs.cv andbwgs.predict .T h e
former is used for missing value imputation, dimensionreduction, and cross validation, while the later is used for
model calibration and estimation of GEBV for selection
candidates.
BGLR
This package is basically an extension of the BLR package ( Perez
and Campos, 2014 ). It can be used to implement several Bayesian
models and also provides ﬂexibility in terms of prior density
distribution. Here, the response to be considered could becontinuous or categorical (either binary or ordinal). It is freelyavailable in the public domain through the CRAN mirror athttps://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BGLR.
GenSel
The GenSel software program was developed and implementedunder the BIGS (Bioinformatics to Implement GenomicSelection) project ( Fernando and Garrick, 2009 ). It is used for
estimation of molecular marker –based breeding values of animals
for the trait of interest. This can serve the purpose through thecommand line (MAC or Linux) interface or as a user-friendlytool. The jobs are submitted and assigned in the queue foranalysis. The software uses the Bayesian approach in thebackground for estimation of marker effects from the trainingdata and further for estimation of GEBV for breeding candidates.
This software program can be accessed at https://github.com/
austin-putz/GenSel.
GSelection
This is an R-based package and is freely available at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GSelection. The packagecomprises of a set of functions to select the important markersand estimates the GEBV of selection candidates using anintegrated model framework ( Majumdar et al., 2019 ). The
motivation behind this package is that not a single methodperforms best in case of all crop plants or animal breeding
programs as they may have diverse genetic architectures,
i.e., additive and non-additive genetic effects. This package hasbeen developed by integrating the best performing model fromeach category of additive and non-additive genetic models.
lme4GS
lme4GS is an R-based package freely available and can beaccessed through the GitHub repository at https://github.com/perpdgo/lme4GS. It is an extension of the lme4 R
package, which is the standard package for ﬁtting linear
mixed models. lme4GS package is basically motivated fromexisting R packages pedigreemm ( Vazquez et al., 2010 )a n d
lme4qtl ( Ziyatdinov et al., 2018 ). lme4GS package can also be
considered an extension of the rrBLUP ( Endelman, 2011 )
package. Further, lme4GS package can be used for ﬁtting
mixed models with covariance structures de ﬁned by the
user, bandwidth selection, and genomic prediction.
STGS
It is an R-based package developed for genomic predictions byestimating marker effects, and the same is further used forcalculation of genotypic merit of individuals, i.e., GEBV. GSmay be based on single-trait or multi-trait information. Thispackage performs genomic selection only for a single trait,hence named STGS, i.e., single-trait genomic selection(Budhlakoti et al., 2019a ). STGS is a comprehensive
package which gives a single-step solution for genomicselection based on most commonly used statistical methods( i . e . ,R R ,B L U P ,L A S S O ,S V M ,A N N ,a n dR F ) .I ti sf r e e l yavailable through the CRAN server at https://CRAN.R-
project.org/package=STGS.
MTGS
It is an R-based package developed for genomic predictions by
estimating marker effects based on information available onmultiple traits. Currently, STGS methods could not utilizeadditional information available when using multi-trait data.
The package MTGS performs genomic selection using multi-
trait information ( Budhlakoti et al., 2019b ). MTGS is a
comprehensive package which gives a single-step solution forgenomic selection using various MTGS-based methods (MRCE,MLASSO, i.e., multivariate LASSO, and KMLASSO,i.e., kernelized multivariate LASSO). It is freely availablethrough the CRAN server at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MTGS.
FACTORS AFFECTING GENOMIC
PREDICTION: EFFECTS OF MARKER
DENSITY, POPULATION SIZE, TRAITARCHITECTURE, AND HERITABILITY
In general, increased marker density enhances the prediction
accuracy using most of the GS models such as BLUP, LASSO,machine learning –based, or deep learning –based methods.
However, there may be a chance of slow convergence inmethods like Bayesian (Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C π,a n d
Bayes D π), where convergence in terms of MCMC
(i.e., Markov chain Monte Carlo) iteration is required
(Arruda et al., 2016 ;Zhang et al., 2017 ;Norman et al.,
2018 ;Zhang et al., 2019 ). Sometimes, low-density markers
of a few hundreds to thousands also enable high predictionaccuracies in breeding popula tions provided that there is a
strong LD among the markers; however, it may be trait speci ﬁc

and may vary with the architecture and heritability of studied
traits ( Lorenz et al., 2011 ;Werner et al., 2018 ). Also sometimes
keeping a very high density of markers may have economicconstraints as incorporation of such aspects into evaluation of
GS strategies is also necessary for a pro ﬁtable and ef ﬁcient GS.
Therefore, it is always dif ﬁcult to give a benchmark for the
number of markers to be used in such genomic studies;however, it is advisable to keep a moderate density, at least2000 SNPs, so that prediction accuracy could not besigniﬁcantly hampered ( Abed et al., 2018 ). However, the
cost of genotyping can also be signi ﬁcantly reduced by
increasing the level of multiplexing without paying anypenalty in terms of genomic prediction accuracy (e.g.,genotyping a single line by GBS (96-plex) can cost 3.75 and4.25 times less than using 9 K and 50 K arrays, respectively, in
barley) ( Abed et al., 2018 ). The position of SNPs and how they
are placed in genomic arrangements over the chromosomem a yh a v eak e yr o l e ,f o re x a m p l e ,S N P sl o c a t e di nt h eintergenic space are slightly better at capturing theunderlying haplotype diversity related to SNPs located inthe genic space as the intergenic space is a playground ofmany important regulatory sequences, such as promoters andenhancers ( Barrett et al., 2012 ;Abed et al., 2018 ). The use of
high-quality SNP genotyping data (i.e., minor allele frequency(MAF) >0.1) could also be suggested to achieve a good
prediction accuracy.
Population size has a signi ﬁcant role in the prediction
accuracy whether it is conventional MAS or genomicselection, especial ly training population. If the population
size or training population size is small, it is obvious that adecrease in accuracy is expected because the model will poorlyestimate the marker effects and hence prediction accuracy.However, as an idea or estimate for the size of trainingpopulation as 2*Ne*L (where N
eis the effective population
s i z ea n dLi st h eg e n o m es i z ei nM o r g a n )a n dt h en u m b e ro fmarkers as 10*Ne*L to achieve a prediction accuracy of 0.9 andreducing the size of the training population to 1*N
e*L results in
a prediction accuracy of 0.7, provided that training population
and breeding population are unrelated or both separated bymany generations ( Meuwissen, 2009 ). However, for most of the
cases, training population and breeding population are related,so high genomic prediction accuracy could be achieved with atraining population size much smaller than that referred above(Meuwissen, 2009 ).
Apart from these factors, prediction accuracy can also be
affected by trait heritability especially for lower heritability(h
2<0.4) ( Hayes et al., 2009 ). Numerous studies up-to-date
showed that genomic selection accuracy is strongly in ﬂuenced
by trait heritability, i.e., the fraction of the phenotypic
variance to the genetic variance of studied traits. Generally,it is assumed that the target trait with high heritability hasgood prediction accuracies and vice versa. However, as mostof the agricultural traits have low to moderate heritability, itposes a challenge to genomic selection studies, especially inplants. However, low heritability traits would require a largertraining population in order to attain the same predictionaccuracy as in the case of traits with moderate to high
heritability. However, to achieve this goal, sometimes costmay be a limiting factor, especially in developing countries.Moreover, it could be observed from the available literature
that even for low heritable and complex traits, the
performance of BLUP and its derivatives (e.g., GBLUP andRRBLUP), Bayesian methods (Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C π,
and Bayes D π) ,a n dR K H Ss e e m st ob er o b u s ta sc o m p a r e dt o
their counterparts ( Crossa et al., 2010 ;Crossa et al., 2011 ;
Heffner et al., 2011 ;Poland et al., 2012 ;Zhao et al., 2013 ;
Spindel et al., 2015 ;Crossa et al., 2017 ;Wang et al., 2018 ;Xu
et al., 2018 ;Juliana et al., 2019 ;Lozada et al., 2019 ;Michel
et al., 2019 ), and at the same time, most of the models work
ﬁne with highly heritable traits, although the most suitable
method is usually case-dependent. Sometimes missing
observations also poses a challenge in estimating GEBV.
However, the issue of low heritable trait and missingobservation could be handled simultaneously, provided thatdata are available on multiple traits. In multiple traits, if wehave few traits with low heritability and at the same time wehave a good correlation with other highly heritable traits,i.e., by using the appropriate MTGS-based model, we canborrow information from other traits. In such scenarios, byusing the MTGS model, we can estimate the GEBV moreprecisely and accurately.
CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTS
G e n o m i cs e l e c t i o nh a ss h o w ni t sp o t e n t i a li np l a n ta n danimal breeding research by increasing genetic gains in thelast two decades. Revolution in terms of cheaper NGStechnologies has made it possible to sequence the crop and
animal genomes at a relatively low cost. It resulted in a
number of completely sequenced crop and animal genomeswith high-density SNP genotyping chips and their availabilityin the public domain, which may further boost the predictiveability of a GS model. Even after more than a decade in theﬁeld of genomic selection studies, still there is a lot of scope
for improvement in this area. Methodological re ﬁnements
(such as imputation of missing genotypic value,implementation of GxE interaction, information onepigenetic regulation, haploty pes, and including multi-trait
information into prediction models) will be de ﬁnitely helpful
for a successful implementation of GS in plant and animal
breeding programs. Consistent updation of the training set
for GS is highly desirable by including the new markers ineach generation. Evaluation of the training populationsshould be done in controlled and well-managed conditionsas it signi ﬁcantly affects the performance of prediction
models. There is a need for a structured program in theﬁeld of genomic selection including human resource
development, advanced data recording methodologies, andtrait phenotyping in order to come out with fruitfuloutcomes.
