ABSTRACT
Genomic selection, the application of genomic prediction (GP) models to select candidate individuals, has
signiﬁcantly advanced in the past two decades, effectively accelerating genetic gains in plant breeding.
This article provides a holistic overview of key factors that have inﬂuenced GP in plant breeding duringthis period. We delved into the pivotal roles of training population size and genetic diversity, and their rela-
tionship with the breeding population, in determining GP accuracy. Special emphasis was placed on opti-
mizing training population size. We explored its beneﬁts and the associated diminishing returns beyond an
optimum size. This was done while considering the balance between resource allocation and maximizing
prediction accuracy through current optimization algorithms. The density and distribution of single-nucle-
otide polymorphisms, level of linkage disequilibrium, genetic complexity, trait heritability, statistical ma-
chine-learning methods, and non-additive effects are the other vital factors. Using wheat, maize, and po-
tato as examples, we summarize the effect of these factors on the accuracy of GP for various traits. The
search for high accuracy in GP—theoretically reaching one when using the Pearson’s correlation as a
metric—is an active research area as yet far from optimal for various traits. We hypothesize that with
ultra-high sizes of genotypic and phenotypic datasets, effective training population optimizationmethods and support from other omics approaches (transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics)
coupled with deep-learning algorithms could overcome the boundaries of current limitations to achieve
the highest possible prediction accuracy, making genomic selection an effective tool in plant breeding.

INTRODUCTION
Global population growth is likely to continue at a similar or faster
pace in the coming decades. Demand for food is expected to in-
crease by the same amount to feed the population while crop pro-
ductivity has been curtailed by various biotic and abiotic stressesexacerbated by anthropogenic climate change. Plant breeding is
fundamental to developing new cultivars with higher yield,improved quality, and tolerance or resistance to several abiotic
and biotic stresses. For example, wheat production at the globallevel has increased from 200 million tons in 1961 to 775 milliontons in 2023 ( FAO, 2023 ) with no signiﬁcant change in total area

of wheat production (220 million hectares). This is principally due
to the development and deployment of semi-dwarf high-yieldingand input-responsive new wheat cultivars ( Borlaug, 2002 ) with
resistance and tolerance to major biotic and abiotic stresses,
respectively, along with improved agronomic management,
mechanization, favorable policies, and infrastructures acrossthe entire wheat value chain ( Tadesse et al., 2019 ).
Genetic enhancement of crops has long relied on conventional
cross-breeding methods whereby breeding and selection of
genotypes are solely based on pedigree and phenotypic perfor-
mance. Rigorous evaluation of parents for different traits, tar-geted crossing, generation advancement using the summerand winter shuttle breeding schemes to shorten the breeding cy-
cle, key location evaluation of elite germplasms, and effective
database management have played signiﬁcant roles in devel-oping improved crop cultivars. However, the expeditious emer-
gence of DNA-sequencing technology has allowed breeders to
gain comprehensive genomic information on crops, which isvery valuable for selection. The development of several DNA-
marker-based genotyping systems signiﬁcantly increased the
number of DNA markers available to plant breeders ( Crossa
et al., 2017 ). This breakthrough allowed plant breeders to select
plant performance based on their genetic marker composition
rather than solely on their phenotypic performance, which isprone to several limitations in selection efﬁciency.
The application of genomic tools in the breeding practice of
plants, generally termed genomic-assisted breeding, has pro-gressed through various stages in the last four decades
(Varshney et al., 2021 ). It started with linkage-based mapping
of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) ( Soller and Plotkin-Hazan, 1977 )
where, with a limited number of DNA markers, those
segregating with a particular trait were identiﬁed as linked to
a QTL and used for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The methodrequired a set of segregating individuals developed from bipa-rental crosses, a time-consuming procedure, with a narrow allelic
variation and poor resolution that leads to low impact in practical
plant-breeding programs ( Bernardo, 2008 ). The genome-wide
association study (GWAS) approach became a popular and
powerful method for identifying markers closely linked to QTLs
of target traits ( Zhu et al., 2008 ;Tibbs Cortes et al., 2021 ).
However, the practical implementation of the method via MAS
has been constrained to limited numbers of major QTLs while
numerous small-effect QTLs in complex traits have remained un-known and unutilized ( Jannink et al., 2010 ).
Genomic selection (GS), when developed GP models are applied
in practical selection, has emerged as a powerful tool in plantbreeding, particularly after the advancement of readily available
genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Besides
early contributors ( Lande and Thompson, 1990 ;Bernardo, 1994 ;
Nejati-Javaremi et al., 1997 ;Haley and Visscher, 1998 ;Whittaker
et al., 2000 ), GS was ﬁrst elaborated two decades ago by
Meuwissen et al. (2001) . In this groundbreaking study, the
authors paved the way to a new avenue in plant breeding,
suggesting that prediction of genetic values from marker proﬁles
could extensively increase genetic gain in plant and animalbreeding, particularly if combined with reproductive techniques
to shorten the generation interval. The conventional MAS
approaches tend to focus solely on a limited set of markers linkedwith well-investigated major QTLs excluding the vast majority of
minor-effect QTLs. In contrast to these methods, GP employs largenumber of genome-wide SNPs to quantify the comprehensive ge-netic merit of individual plants encompassing most contributing
QTLs of a target trait ( Bernardo and Yu, 2007 ;Heffner et al.,
2009 ). The continued rapid advancement of next-generation
sequencing technology to produce dense genome-wide SNP
markers, coupled with its substantial cost reduction for genotyping
in several crops, makes GS a must-implement method in mostbreeding programs. Empirical research has shown the advantage
of GS for accelerating the genetic gains per unit of time over
pedigree-based selection. GS has emerged with huge potentialto reduce the cost per breeding cycle, increase selection intensityand accuracy, and signiﬁcantly reduce the time required to develop
a cultivar compared to phenotypic-based selection ( Crossa et al.,
2010 ,2017 ;Edwards et al., 2019 ).
Developing statistical machine-learning models and training pop-
ulation optimization are the two main thematic areas activelyexplored in plant GP research. This is because of their potential
to improve the prediction accuracy while the current achievement
is far from optimal. This review begins with a simpliﬁed explana-tion of GP followed by an exploration of the up-to-date widely
applied cross-validation (CV) methods in plant breeding. After a
comprehensive overview, details of the key factors affecting GPaccuracy identiﬁed over the last two decades are elaborated.Moreover, empirical research results are analyzed using wheat,
maize, and potato as examples of self-pollinating, cross-polli-
nating, and clonally propagated crops, respectively, to illustrate
the impact of the identiﬁed factors on the accuracy of GP in
various traits. Finally yet importantly, the implementation of GS
is highlighted in a showcase example from ongoing empiricalstudies from public and private breeding programs. In summary,
valuable suggestions are forwarded to support the successful im-
plementation of GS in plant-breeding programs.
GENOMIC PREDICTION
GP is the most recent data-driven method that has been widelyaccepted and used as a valuable tool to accelerate genetic gainin plant-breeding programs ( Desta and Ortiz, 2014 ;Bassi et al.,
2016 ;Xu et al., 2020 ). GP employs advanced statistical machine-
learning models to select individuals within a breeding population
based on breeding values estimated from genome-wide markers.This selection process relies on data from a training population,
encompassing both phenotypic and genotypic information
(Figure 1 A). After a rigorous training procedure, these models
generate predictions of breeding or phenotypic values for traits of
a target population consisting only of genotypic data. However,
the performance of prediction models should be ﬁrst evaluatedthrough CV before applying selection (see the next section fordetails of CV methods). This step in GP is critical in order to
evaluate the performance of prediction models and compare
different sets of statistical machine-learning models with variousscenarios, such as incorporating multiple traits, known major
genes and marker-trait associations (QTLs), genotype 3environ-
ment (G 3E) interaction, and other omics data such as transcrip-
tomics, metabolomics, and proteomics ( Figure 1 A).
Comparisons among GP methods are evaluated through their
prediction accuracy, which is directly linked to the breeder’s

equation ( Akdemir and Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ). Various factors
can affect GP, and the accuracy score varies signiﬁcantlyacross experiments for a single trait. For instance, theprediction accuracy of a single trait in wheat, maize, and potato
hugely varied across different experimental research due to
the different setups in training population composition,applied statistical machine-learning models, and other factors
(Supplemental Tables 1–3 ). The GP accuracy ( r
MG[correlation
between marker predicted value with true predicted geneticvalue]) is measured as the Pearson’s correlation between
genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) and true breeding
value ( Combs and Bernardo, 2013 ;Isidro et al., 2015 ), which
gives an estimate of selection accuracy ( Merrick et al., 2022 ).
Selection accuracy is directly related to selection response ( R),
also known as genetic gain, and in the breeders’ equation is
calculated as R=irs
A=t, where iand rare the selection
intensity and accuracy, respectively; while sAis the square root
of the additive genetic variance and tis the cycle time ( Falconer
and Mackay, 1996 ).
GP considers the breeding values of parental average and
deviation of Mendelian sampling to deﬁne GEBVs of anoffspring, which allows the method to be used for: (1) rapid se-
lection cycle with short breeding interval at early generations
via prediction of the additive effects (i.e., GS at the F
2level
of a biparental cross); and (2) selection of lines at late stagesof selection by predicting the genotypic values of individuals,
with both additive and non-additive effects determining the
ﬁnal commercial value of the lines ( Crossa et al., 2014 ;
Dreisigacker et al., 2023 ).
Numerous factors affect GP and can signiﬁcantly reduce its
accuracy ( Figure 1 B). Consequently, unless adequately
addressed, they can hinder the effective utilization of GP in
plant-breeding programs. The population size, genetic diversity,and genetic relatedness with the breeding population are keyfeatures to target during training population optimization.
Factors such as the level of linkage disequilibrium between
QTLs and markers (in both the training and breeding [testing]population), genetic complexity and heritability of target traits,
quality/precision phenotyping, statistical machine-learning
models, G 3E interaction, and other non-additive factors are the
other major features that further complicate GP in plant breeding.
CROSS-VALIDATION METHODS
CV is a fundamental technique in statistical machine-learning
methods that aids model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning,
and ensuring robust model performance. It plays a crucial rolein building models that can make accurate predictions on new,unseen data while avoiding overﬁtting and data-speciﬁc biases.
GP models should initially be evaluated using CV methods beforeapplying for the selection of candidate individuals in the breedingpopulation. CV simulates the model’s prediction performance by
dividing the training population (training set; TRS) into calibration
and validation sets.
Different GP CV methods are utilized depending on various deter-
mining scenarios ( Figure 2 ). The K-fold CV is one of the most
widely applied methods, where the entire dataset is divided into
an equal number of folds. In the 5-fold CV method, for example,
the TRS dataset is randomly grouped into 5-folds and predictionmodels are trained using the 4-folds as a calibration set while theremaining fold is used as a validation set. The accuracy could be
measured after either averaging multiple runs from each fold or
averaging runs comprising all folds. Leave-one-out CV (LOOCV)is the other method in which a single genotype is excluded
from the calibration set and used as the validation set in each sin-
gle iteration. An equal number of CV iterations are required withthe number of samples or genotypes in this method. Hence,
LOOCV is computationally intensive and only suitable for few ge-
notypes (samples), while the 5-fold CV method is ideal for largedatasets ( Cheng et al., 2017 ). The other CV scenario has arisen
in the case of multi-environment GP analysis ( Crossa et al.,
2017 ). Cross-validation 1 (CV1) is a scenario in which the
GEBVs of newly developed lines or varieties are predicted intested environments, thus being CV1 appropriate for predicting
untested lines in tested environments. CV2, also known as sparse
testing, is a method for genotypes tested in some environmentsand predicted in other tested environments. For this reason,
CV2 is a reasonable option for predicting tested lines in tested en-
vironments. The other scenarios are CV0, which arises from theprediction of tested genotypes in an untested (unobserved) envi-
ronment, while CV00 is used for predicting GEBVs of untested
genotypes in unobserved environment ( Figure 2 ).
TRAINING POPULATION
A TRS is used to establish the statistical relationship between ge-
netic markers and phenotypic data for target traits to predict the
phenotypic performance of individuals from their genotypic
proﬁle. In GP, the TRS should ﬁrst be optimized to enhance the pre-diction accuracy and efﬁciency in breeding programs (see ‘‘ training
population optimization ’’). The optimized TRS can be of two types
during the GP model optimization and application in the practicalselection scenario. The ﬁrst type is the parcel of the optimizedTRS (calibration set) used to train the prediction models and
estimate the GEBVs of the remaining individuals within the TRS
(validation set) via CVs ( Figure 1 A). The second type is the overall
optimized TRS applied to train the optimized GP models in a
The optimized model with the highest possible prediction accuracy is identiﬁed and applied to predict GEBV of the breeding population followed by
selection of individuals based on their genetic merit for target traits.
(B)Various factors affect genomic prediction accuracy in plant-breeding programs. These factors arise from diverse sources at different stages durin g the
analysis. Population size and genetic diversity of the training population, genetic relationship (kinship) and population structure of the traini ng population
with the breeding population, and quality of the phenotypic data applied in the statistical machine-learning models are features connected with tra ining
population and should be optimized during TRS development. Other factors including density and distribution of genetic markers across chromosomes ,
level of linkage disequilibrium between QTL alleles and marker alleles, genetic complexity and heritability of target traits, applied statistical methods, and
non-additive genetic factors such as genotype-by-environment (G 3E) interactions hugely affect the ﬁnal output of the GP accuracy. TRS, training

Features of the TRS including the population size, genetic diversityand genetic relatedness with the BS, population structure, level of
linkage disequilibrium (LD) related to the BS, and the quality of
phenotypic and genotypic data signiﬁcantly affect the GP accuracy(Pszczola et al., 2012 ;Crossa et al., 2014 ;Hickey et al., 2014 ;Zhang
et al., 2017a ;Edwards et al., 2019 ).
Sample size of the training population
The ultimate goal of plant breeders is to achieve highly accurate
but inexpensive estimates of genetic value ( Lorenz and Nice,
2017 ). In GP, increasing the TRS size could inﬂict both positive
and negative consequences for successful implementation in
plant breeding ( Merrick et al., 2022 ). The size of the TRS affects
the accuracy of GP models ( Goddard, 2009 ;Daetwyler et al.,
2010 ;Combs and Bernardo, 2013 ;Bassi et al., 2016 ) and often
correlates positively with the increase in size ( Lorenzana and
Bernardo, 2009 ;Zhong et al., 2009 ;Albrecht et al., 2011 ;
Bentley et al., 2014 ;Isidro et al., 2015 ). However, research has
shown a plateau in prediction-accuracy increment afterreaching an optimum TRS size ( Arruda et al., 2015 ;Sverrisdo ´ttiret al., 2018 ;Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2023 ). Increasing the
size of TRS demands greater effort and higher costs required
for phenotyping as the genotyping cost has been signiﬁcantlyreduced. In addition, increasing the TRS could adversely affect
the quality of collected phenotypic data, leading to reduced
prediction accuracy. The TRS optimization encircles balancingto achieve the highest possible r
MGwith minimum resource
allocation through selective phenotyping ( Figure 3 A) (Lorenz
and Nice, 2017 ;Akdemir and Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ). Research
has been conducted to identify an optimized TRS size and
demonstrate the effects of numerous determining factors, such
as the genetic kinship and population structure with the BS, LDextent, heritability, and genetic architecture of target traits(Isidro et al., 2015 ;Akdemir and Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ;Sarinelli
et al., 2019 ). Broadly, to achieve a higher r
MG, the size of TRS
should increase when the genetic kinship with the BSdecreases. Likewise, accuracy is often low for less-heritable
traits, which is directly related to the complexity of the genetic ar-
chitecture with several contributing small-effect QTLs and whenLD between markers and QTLs is low ( Habier et al., 2007 ;
Daetwyler et al., 2010 ;Clark et al., 2012 ;Combs and Bernardo,
2013 ;Wientjes et al., 2013 ;Isidro et al., 2015 ). New

Figure 2. Genomic prediction cross-validation methods in plant breeding.
With the 5-fold cross-validation method, the complete population is initially allocated at random to 5-folds (F5). The 4-folds are then used as a cali bration
set in order to develop the GP model while retaining the remaining one as a validation set. A single genotype is excluded from the calibration set in the
LOOCV, and its GEBV is predicted in every iteration. In multi-environment GP, a newly developed untested genotype can be predicted in tested envi-ronments (CV1), a genotype tested in some environments but untested in others (also known as sparse testing [CV2]), tested genotype predicted in anuntested environment (CV0), and an untested genotype in an untested environment (CV00).

Population structure and genetic relationship with
breeding population
One of the pitfalls of GP in a practical breeding scenario is the
inability to develop a dependent and effective TRS in the longterm without targeting any speciﬁc BS. Because of this, breeding
programs have to update and optimize the TRS at every singlestage where selection is assisted with GP models (see ‘‘ training
population optimization ’’). This is because the genetic kinship,
population structure, and the extent of LD between the trainingand breeding populations play a huge role in the accuracy.
Hence, developing a TRS targeting the candidates for selection
is the most critical step in GP ( Akdemir et al., 2015 ;Lorenz
and Smith, 2015 ;Akdemir and Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ). Adding

(A)The objective of training population optimization is to maximize the genetic gain of plant breeding by enhancing the GP accuracy while minimizing the
phenotyping costs by reducing the size of training population.(B and C) (B) The targeted and untargeted training set optimization methods and (C)optimization approaches with historical and new ﬁeld trials data. The
aim of TRS optimization is to ﬁnd a subset of a CS to be used as an optimal TRS to make predictions on a target population of interest. In targeted
optimization, there must be a test set containing genotypes different to those in the CS, which is common when working with historical data. The targetpopulation includes this independent test set, but it may contain the genotypes in the RS as well if predicting their genotypic values is of interest. T he
genotypic information of the target population can then be used as an input on the optimization algorithm that allows the abstention of a training set
speciﬁcally tailored for it. Conversely, in the untargeted TRS optimization scenario, there is no independent test set, which is common for selectiv e
phenotyping of new ﬁeld trials. In this scenario, the target population comprises all genotypes in the CS whose genotypic values are of special intere st.
The target population would often be equal to the RS, but it can also be the entirety of the CS. The TRS data may be of two types: historical data and datafrom new ﬁeld trials. When both data sources are available, their subsequent TRS can be combined to maximize model performance. It is worth noting
that the steps highlighted as targeted mandate the availability of genotypic information from the test set. There may also be instances of population
overlap within the process should the GEBVs of the remaining set form a prediction target; for example, RS inherently forms a part of the test set. TRS,training set; CS, candidate set; RS, remaining set; TS, test/target set; E, environment; G, genotype.

genetically unrelated individuals in the training population
adversely affects the GP models, as has been shown witha reduction in r
MG(Habier et al., 2010 ;Clark et al., 2012 ;
Lorenz and Smith, 2015 ;Alemu et al., 2023 ). For instance,
Riedelsheimer et al. (2013) reported a huge decline (42%) in
prediction accuracy when the training and breeding populationwas changed from within full-sib double haploid (DH) maize lines
to between half-sib DH lines.
A speciﬁc population having distinct allele frequency from others
due to founder effects and selection processes creates popula-
tion structure ( Isidro et al., 2015 ;Norman et al., 2018 ). This
allele frequency difference often bring association betweenphenotypic performances with markers, irrespective of their true
linkage to the causative QTL, which causes bias on r

arise within the TRS or between the TRS and BS, and bothaffect prediction models. Research indicates an adverse impact
of population structure on r

argued that natural and artiﬁcial breeding populations alwayshave different degrees of stratiﬁcation due to differences inallele frequency and LD patterns that act as a modiﬁer effect
rather than a confounding effect. Daetwyler et al. (2012)
mentioned that the key is accounting for spurious populationstructure, such as that originating from admixtures, but without
affecting relatedness between individuals. Nevertheless, several
research studies indicated a signiﬁcant reduction in GPaccuracy when population structure was accounted in the
statistical analysis ( Guo et al., 2014 ;Norman et al., 2018 ;
Werner et al., 2020 ;Callister et al., 2022 ). Different strategies
have been proposed to account population structure in GP.Admixing individuals from different groups during TRS
optimization and phenotyping is one option to connect the
different populations ( Esfandyari et al., 2015 ;Rio et al., 2019 ).
Accounting population structure by exploiting the mean
performances of subpopulations deﬁned through breeding
origin, pedigree, or molecular markers is the other developedmethod ( Albrecht et al., 2011 ;Windhausen et al., 2012 ;Guo
et al., 2014 ). Another approach is incorporating principal
components and admixture coefﬁcients derived from a genomicrelationship matrix as covariates in GP mixed models as ﬁxed
effects ( Daetwyler et al., 2012 ;Crossa et al., 2016b ;Edriss et al.,
2017 ). However, this method has limitations, such as inability to
account markers’ effect difference across subpopulations(Lehermeier et al., 2015 ) and ‘‘double counting’’ of population
structure ( Janss et al., 2012 ). Different approaches have been
proposed to overcome this problem, such as genomic bestlinear unbiased prediction (G-BLUP) re-parameterization and
modeling genetic covariances between individuals from different
groups by adapting multi-trait models ( Janss et al., 2012 ;Guo
et al., 2014 ;Lehermeier et al., 2015 ).
Genetic diversity
Genetic diversity of the TRS is the other major contributing factor
in GP ( Habier et al., 2007 ;Lorenzana and Bernardo, 2009 ;Normanet al., 2018 ;Berro et al., 2019 ). Including individuals with diverse
genetic backgrounds helps to capture the full spectrum ofgenetic variants inﬂuencing the target traits. This diversityensures that the predictive models can accurately capture the
genetic effects and make reliable predictions across a wide
range of genetic backgrounds. The TRS should encompass abroad range of allelic variation for the traits of interest to capture
maximum possible contributing QTLs ( Norman et al., 2018 ).
However, it has to be developed targeting the BS, sinceincreasing the diversity with individuals genetically distant from
the BS negatively affect the GP model accuracy ( Crossa et al.,
2014 ;Akdemir and Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ;Berro et al., 2019 ).
TRAINING POPULATION OPTIMIZATION
The GP efﬁciency in practical breeding scenarios is highly depen-
dent on the rMGof the genetic merit of candidate individuals.
Extensive research supports the notion that conﬁguring theoptimal TRS is critical to determine the prediction accuracy
(Lorenzana and Bernardo, 2009 ;Riedelsheimer et al., 2012 ;
Isidro et al., 2015 ;Akdemir and Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ;Berro
et al., 2019 ;Ou and Liao, 2019 ;Isidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir,
2021 ;Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2023 ). An inadequately
constructed TRS substantially diminishes prediction accuracies,while optimized TRS signiﬁcantly improves accuracy (see
Isidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir, 2021 ). The TRS optimization
aims to maximize the accuracy of the predictions made on atest or target set (TS) while minimizing the TRS size to reducephenotyping costs ( Figure 3 A) (Crossa et al., 2017 ).
The TRS optimization is key in plant-breeding programs for three
main reasons. First, as predictions rely on markers or line effects
determined by the TRS, there is a need to carefully curate the TRS
to enhance the efﬁciency and efﬁcacy of GS. Second, the sub-stantial costs of phenotyping have driven the search for innova-
tive alternatives to reduce expenditure ( Isidro y Sa ´nchez and
Akdemir, 2021 ). Breeding programs can allocate resources
more efﬁciently by focusing on a smaller yet representative
TRS. This not only reduces phenotyping expenditure but also
enhances the quality of data applied in the GP models. Thisallows breeding programs to invest in advanced tools forintricate traits or increase the number of measurements for
speciﬁc traits, an approach termed sparse or selective
phenotyping. Third, the conventional TRS methods that relyon random sampling do not always lead to improved
predictive capability due to an under-representation or over-
representation of critical genetic information. Thus, optimizationserves to streamline the sparse phenotyping process, aiming to
curtail phenotyping expenses while preserving or enhancing pre-
diction models’ accuracy.
There are two key aspects in TRS optimization: (1) TRS is a
dynamic population that must be updated through the breeding
cycle ( Lorenz and Smith, 2015 ;Pszczola and Calus, 2016 ;
Akdemir and Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ); and (2) the test set needs
to be taken into account when building the TRS ( Akdemir and
Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ;Isidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir, 2021 ;
Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2023 ).
Here, we review the types of populations available in breeding
programs and their role during TRS optimization, the applied
558 Molecular Plant 17, 552–578, April 1 2024 ª2024 The Author.Molecular Plant Genomic selection in plant breeding
methodologies, and the broader implications on GP accuracy
and efﬁciency. We offer the perspectives of TRS optimization inthe context of the broader breeding landscape. We do not delveinto the exhaustive details of every algorithm or methods and
associated pros and cons that can be found elsewhere, such
asIsidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir (2021) . Nevertheless, a
summary of the key developed algorithms for TRS optimization
can be found in Supplemental Table 4 .
Breeding population types involved in optimization
In GS-assisted breeding, the classiﬁcation and utilization of
different breeding population sets are crucial in streamlining theprediction process and maximizing the efﬁciency of the breedingpipeline. Each set plays a distinct role, and its composition can
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the accuracy and effectiveness of GP.
The summary of breeding population sets and their respectivepurposes and interrelations can be summarized as follows.
(1) Candidate set (CS): collection of genotypes available to
breeders. Optimization aims to identify an optimal CS sub-
set to be used as the TRS ( Figure 3 B).
(2) Remaining set (RS): includes genotypes from the CS not
selected for the TRS. When accompanied by phenotypic
data, RS enhances the evaluation of model performance.
(3) Training or calibration set (TRS): basis for the GP equation,
containing both genotypic and phenotypic data. The goal
is to maximize accuracy on the TS with minimal pheno-
typic and genotypic information.
(4) Test or target set (TS): a set of genotypes to be predicted.
It holds only the genotypic information required to predict
their GEBVs. However, genotypic information may or may
not be available in time for the TRS optimization step.
Optimization scenarios
The TRS is often constructed with new ﬁeld trials datasets. How-
ever, it can be supplemented with old historical data, and optimi-
zation can be performed on both data sources ( Figure 3 C).
(1) (Historical data: utilizing a CS that encompasses compre-
hensive historical data with both genotyped and pheno-typed information can enrich the TRS in terms of size
and diversity, a key advantage in GS ( Pszczola et al.,
2012 ;Rincent et al., 2012 ;Isidro y Sa ´nchez and
Akdemir, 2021 ;Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2024 ).
Increasing sample size improves the potential to capture
the majority of many allele effects and enhance therobustness and accuracy of GP models ( Akdemir and
Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ;Isidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir,
2021 ;Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2024 ). Such inclusion
could however diminish the TRS’s resemblance to theTS and may adversely affect the prediction accuracy
(Lorenz and Smith, 2015 ), prompting the need for
optimization.
(2) New ﬁeld trials: sparse testing is suggested in cases where
the CS provides only genotypic data with limited ﬁeld trials
preventing complete phenotyping ( Crespo-Herrera et al.,
2021 ;Montesinos-Lo ´pez et al., 2023a ;Melchinger et al.,
2023 ). In this scenario, an optimal experimental design
could be designed as follows: (1) determine the subsetfrom CS to undergo ﬁeld-testing, thereby forming theTRS (TRS optimization); (2) for multi-environment trials,
ascertain the ideal TRS genotype distribution across loca-
tions; and (3) deﬁne the most effective genotype distribu-
tion within the ﬁeld (which genotype in which plots). Steps2 and 3 represent ordered optimization focusing on thestrategic optimal spatial arrangement of genotypes.
TRS optimization is categorized as either targeted or untargeted
depending on the availability of genotypic information from
the TS ( Figure 3 B). Targeted optimization takes advantage
of TS genotypic information to construct the TRS andoften outperforms the untargeted approaches ( Akdemir and
Isidro-Sa ´nchez, 2019 ;Isidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir, 2021 ;
Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2023 ). Even without TS genotype
information, a detailed pedigree linking the CS with TS remains
feasible in targeted optimization. However, research in this area
is lacking. Unordered optimization focuses on selecting a CSsubset, while ordered optimization emphasizes the spatialgenotype distribution in the ﬁeld. The latter may utilize
data related to blocking structures, spatial inﬂuences, and
environmental variables ( Akdemir et al., 2021 ).
Training population optimization algorithms
Several design criteria have been proposed for selecting and
optimizing the TRS in GP. The classical standard random or
stratiﬁed sampling method is commonly applied because of itssimplicity. Nevertheless, GP accuracy enhancement has beenachieved using other optimization criteria, which can be classi-
ﬁed as parametric, non-parametric, and multiple design criteria.
Many of the established criteria mostly serve as evaluation met-rics for the TRS, and appropriate heuristic is imperative to maxi-
mize or minimize it. Numerous R program packages have been
developed and provide suitable heuristics often based on geneticalgorithms. For instance, the STPGA ( Akdemir, 2017 ), TSDFGS
(Ou and Liao, 2019 ), and odw ( Butler et al., 2013 ) are
developed but are limited to built-in criteria. In contrast,TrainSel ( Akdemir et al., 2021 ) supports both built-in and user-
deﬁned criteria.
Parametric design criteriaParametric design criteria assume that the researcher predeter-mines a model prior to data collection. These criteria typically
rely on a scalar function tied to the model’s information matrix.
In practice, it is usually derived from the prediction errorvariance-covariance matrix (PEV) for the additive genotypic ef-
fects in linear mixed models. The A, D, and E criteria ( Laloe ¨,
1993 ), the coefﬁcient of determination criterion (CD_mean), and
the prediction error variance criterion (PEV_mean) are examples
(Laloe ¨, 1993 ). Parametric criteria are a powerful approach but
are computationally intensive. Attempts have been made toresolve this problem, including updating the PEV matrix in eachiteration instead of calculating de novo (Butler et al., 2013 ) and
applying principal component analysis to reduce dimensionality
such as in PEV_mean
ridgeand CD_meanridgemethods ( Akdemir
et al., 2015 ;Heslot and Feoktistov, 2020 ). An in-depth discussion
on computational efﬁciency of algorithms is available in
Supplemental File 1 ,Note 2 .
Sparse selection index is a recently proposed prediction
model with a built-in optimization process ( Lopez-Cruz and de
los Campos, 2021 ;Lopez-Cruz et al., 2021 ;Lopez-Cruz et al.,
Molecular Plant 17, 552–578, April 1 2024 ª2024 The Author. 559Genomic selection in plant breeding Molecular Plant
2022 ). Here, a selection index that speciﬁes the TS genotypic
values as a linear combination of the CS ones is deﬁned. Theregression coefﬁcients of the linear combination are subjectedto a lasso regularization (L1) penalty to enforce sparsity that is
equivalent to the selection of a subset of the genotypes as a
TRS. This is conceptually similar to the bandwidth parameter inthe reproducing kernel Hilbert space ( De Los Campos et al.,
2009 ;Lopez-Cruz et al., 2021 ) but takes it one-step further.
This method is suitable for historical data optimization becauseit makes a speciﬁc TRS for each TS individual and the phenotypic
information of the CS should be available for parameter tuning.
Non-parametric design criteriaThe methods of this type do not assume any predeﬁned underly-ing models but often revolve around metrics of distance or
similarity with the intention of uniformly distributing the TRS
throughout the design landscape, a method known as space-ﬁlling design. Such designs particularly facilitate the selection of
a condensed set of candidates and minimize the computational
complexity associated with the optimization of parametric designcriteria. Various metrics assist in evaluating the distribution of
points within this design space. For instance, the partition around
medoids approach centers on identifying a series of centralentities, termed medoids, within clusters based on a speciﬁc
distance measure ( Guo et al., 2019 ). In general, methods for
representative subset selection in data mining could be usedfor training set design, which opens up many possibilities.Numerous metrics have been developed to minimize genetic
relationships within the TRS (i.e., maximizing diversity) and/or
maximizing its relationship to the TS, for example, the maximinand minimax ( Johnson et al., 1990 ), Avg_GRM ( Atanda et al.,
2021a ), OPT_MIN ( Lemeunier et al., 2022 ), Avg_GRM self,
and Avg_GRM_MinMax ( Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2023 ).
Latin hypercube sampling ( Helton and Davis, 2003 ) involves
segmenting the design space into equal cubes. The objective is
to ensure that each cube hosts a single sample point, furtheraiming to comprehensively explore the range of each scalarinput in alignment with a given probability distribution. Tails and
Tails_GEBVs select genotypes with extreme phenotype or
GEBVs for the TRS and discard the rest ( Neyhart et al., 2017 ;
Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2024 ). Adversarial selection tries to
ensure that the TRS and TS are indistinguishable by a binary
classiﬁer; i.e., their similarity is maximized ( Montesinos-Lo ´pez
and Montesinos-Lo ´pez, 2023 ).
Multi-objective criteria
This method attempts to handle the choice issue by combiningthe different criteria into one with some type of averaging
methods such as the Pareto front approach ( Akdemir et al.,
2015 ;Isidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir, 2021 ). It is adept at
evaluating multiple criteria and deﬁning a suite of non-dominated designs. The method has been effectively applied to
optimize the integration of historical data balancing the TRS di-
versity, its association with the TS, and trial heritability with anextensive empirical dataset from an industrial breeding program
(Isidro y Sa ´nchez and Akdemir, 2021 ;Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez
et al., 2024 ).
Summary of the key algorithms
A detailed comparison and breakdown of TRS optimization
methods and algorithms can be found in Supplemental Table 4 .
However, the large number of available methods makes selecting
a single effective method challenging. Recent research on
TRS optimization offers invaluable insights into selectionof appropriate methods. Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´
lez et al. (2023)
conducted an extensive comparison of these optimizationmethods across various datasets and genetic architectures. Inlight of their ﬁndings and those of other researchers, we provided
a small summary focusing on the key algorithms for each ﬁeld
within TRS optimization. Furthermore, an in-depth, systematicexample on the implementation of CDmean and Avg_GRM_self is
provided in Supplemental File 1 ,Note 1 and an R-script with
example of implementing two algorithms on real TRS optimizationscenario ( Supplemental File 2 ). Nevertheless, it is important to note
that there is no single best algorithm in all aspects, and some of the
methods in Supplemental Table 4 may be more suitable for niche
applications.
Here, we forward our recommendation of general-purpose,
effective methods that constitute a good ﬁrst option for new opti-
mization projects.
(1) TRS size optimization: tailored mainly for situations
incorporating historical data, two main algorithms
emerge:
oTarget accuracy methods: aimed at predicting GP accu-
racy and identifying the minimal TRS size without substan-
tial accuracy loss ( Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2023 ;Wu
et al., 2023 ). In our experience Avg_GRM_self is the
best option due to its fast computational time, essential
in this application. Importantly, budgetary constraintsplay a crucial role, but typically, including 50%–85% ofthe entire candidate population maintains an accuracy
decrease below 5%.
oBest solution methods: these seek the optimal TRS size
by identifying local maxima or inﬂection points. For
example, Avg_GRM_MinMax ( Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al.,
2023 ) and Min_GRM ( Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2024 ).
(2) Optimizing TRS composition: an extensively researched
area. Findings suggest that targeted optimization usually
surpasses untargeted methods, with CDmean being high-ly efﬁcient, albeit computationally intensive. Maintaining
TRS diversity is especially important in the presence of a
strong population structure. Therefore, it is advisable toapply CDmean for smaller datasets, while the fastAvg_GRM_self (untargeted) or Avg_GRM_MinMax (tar-
geted) are suitable for larger datasets.
(3) Simultaneous size and composition optimization: beneﬁcial
when utilizing historical data and the training set size is not
determined by available ﬁeld resources, although it may
reduce the versatility of the algorithm for optimization ofnew ﬁeld trials due to the potential difﬁculty of matching
optimal TRS size to actual ﬁeld resources. MaxCD ( Guo
et al., 2019 ) was originally described for TRS design in
hybrid breeding, but we believe that its ability of optimizingTRS size could be useful for optimization in historical data.
The latter role could be ﬁlled by other methods such as
adversarial selection ( Montesinos-Lopez et al., 2023a ,
2023b ) or multi-objective optimization ( Akdemir et al.,
2021 ;Ferna ´ndez-Gonza ´lez et al., 2024 ), which are not
speciﬁc to hybrids.
(4) Spatial distribution/ordered optimization: pertinent for new
ﬁeld trials, this optimization is computationally demanding,
especially when incorporating environmental or spatialdata. Two notable R package algorithms, ‘‘odw’’ ( Butler
560 Molecular Plant 17, 552–578, April 1 2024 ª2024 The Author.Molecular Plant Genomic selection in plant breeding
et al., 2013 ) and ‘‘TrainSel’’ ( Akdemir et al., 2021 ), have
been developed for this purpose. Parametric criteria
such as A-opt and CDmean are the best-suited ap-
proaches for this application
DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF
MARKERS AND LINKAGEDISEQUILIBRIUM
Increasing the density of SNP markers distributed across chro-
mosomes helps to accurately capture most contributing QTL ul-
timately leading to an increased rMG. The number of SNP markers
required to develop an optimum GP depends on the genome size,extent of LD, and complexity of the trait under investigation. A
study targeting a complex trait controlled by several QTLs (e.g.,
yield) in a crop with a large genome size and low LD relatively re-quires a highly dense SNP marker distributed across chromo-
somes. On the contrary, a highly heritable trait controlled by fewer
genes and with high LD could need a relatively low SNP markerdensity to reach the maximum possible r
MG. In addition, LD in
outcrossing crops, such as maize, decays rapidly compared to
self-crossing crops (e.g., rice) ( Flint-Garcia et al., 2003 ;Kaler
et al., 2022 ), requiring highly dense SNP marker distribution to
achieve the optimum rMG. In general, the optimum density and
distribution of SNP markers relies on the most contributing QTLof a target trait being under LD with DNA markers included inprediction models ( Hayes and Goddard, 2001 ;Kaler et al.,
2022 ). The pattern of LD of populations particularly helps to
develop GP models with cost-effective, low-density SNP markers(Bolormaa et al., 2015 ;Wu et al., 2016 ;Silva et al., 2018 ;Ballesta
et al., 2020 ).
Optimizing the marker density in GP could be beneﬁcial, as most
SNPs in large marker datasets are phenotypically neutral and
contain only a relatively small proportion of SNPs relevant for aspeciﬁc trait ( Bermingham et al., 2015 ;Al Kalaldeh et al., 2019 ;
Weber et al., 2023 ). Selecting optimal subsets of markers for
speciﬁc traits has been a promising approach to increase theaccuracy in GP ( Bermingham et al., 2015 ;van den Berg et al.,
2016 ;Filho et al., 2019 ;Alemu et al., 2023 ;Weber et al., 2023 ).
One method for marker subsetting is selection based on
previous association mapping studies. A beneﬁcial GPaccuracy improvement was observed when signiﬁcant markers
identiﬁed through GWAS were ﬁtted as ﬁxed effects ( Kim et al.,
2022 ;Anilkumar et al., 2023 ;Chen et al., 2023 ), only the top
100–10 000 markers with highest signiﬁcance were used as
predictors ( Bermingham et al., 2015 ;Filho et al., 2019 ),
or markers surrounding the signiﬁcant markers were included(van den Berg et al., 2016 ;Filho et al., 2019 ). Another
optimization approach is applying haplotype blocks based on
marker LD in prediction models ( Alemu et al., 2023 ;Weber
et al., 2023 ). Predictions based on haplotype blocks, rather
than single SNP markers, could efﬁciently capture local
epistasis and better account for LD to QTLs leading to
improved GP accuracy ( Weber et al., 2023 ). Selection of marker
panels can highly inﬂuence trait associations, and several
research articles have demonstrated the impact of marker
density on the GP accuracy ( Zhang et al., 2017a ,2019 ;Liu
et al., 2018 ;Norman et al., 2018 ).GENETIC ARCHITECTURE AND
HERITABILITY OF TRAITS
Most crop traits of economic importance, such as yield, are multi-
genic and have a complex genetic architecture involving severalQTLs or genes with varying levels of phenotypic effects. One of
the key advantages of GP over the conventional MAS methods
is its ability to efﬁciently evaluate genotypes for such geneticallycomplex multigenic traits by considering the high numbers of
small-effect QTLs. Generally, genetic complexity and heritability
(h
2) are directly related to the number of QTLs and their interac-
tion to control a trait. A trait controlled by small numbers of
large-effect QTLs usually has higher heritability than those with
several genes with different levels of genotypic effect. GP isaffected by the complexity of traits, genetic architecture, andheritability. A trait with low h
2should be compensated by
increasing the TRS size ( N) to achieve an optimum GP accuracy,
since Nh2determines the power of GP models ( Bernardo, 2016 ).
Furthermore, machine-learning models that account for epistatic
interactions have the potential to improve the prediction accuracy
when epistatic interaction largely or partially contributes to thetrue genetic architecture of a trait ( De Los Campos et al., 2010 ;
Wang et al., 2012 ;Morgante et al., 2018 ). Several empirical
investigations and simulation research have demonstrated thatther
MGgenerally increases as the number of QTLs decreases
and trait heritability increases ( Hayes et al., 2009 ;Lorenzana
and Bernardo, 2009 ;Zhong et al., 2009 ;Jannink et al., 2010 ;
Combs and Bernardo, 2013 ;Zhang et al., 2017a ;Jung
et al., 2020 ).
PRECISION PHENOTYPING
The phenotypic data recorded from the TRS is required to con-
nect the genomic proﬁle with the phenotype, enabling GP modelsto evaluate and provide weights to individual SNP markers. These
markers are then used to assess individuals in the BS solely from
their genomic proﬁle and assist selection and decision making inbreeding programs. High-density SNP markers combined with
precision phenotyping evaluated in suitable statistical machine-
learning models could link the genome with the phenome ofcrops, leading to GP models with high prediction accuracy. Efﬁ-ciency limitations of the conventional plant phenotyping methods
have been considered as the bottleneck to successfully connect-
ing the bridge between genotype with phenotype information(Araus and Cairns, 2014 ;Araus et al., 2018 ). Hence, advanced
technologies for high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) and high-
throughput ﬁeld phenotyping (HTFP) methods have attractedtremendous attention recently for their potential to provide
comprehensive and precise phenotypic data for primary as
well as secondary traits in several crops ( Cabrera-Bosquet
et al., 2012 ;Araus and Cairns, 2014 ;Zhang et al., 2017b ;Araus
et al., 2018 ;Moreira et al., 2020 ). The HTP and HTFP can
be referred to collectively as the high-throughput phenotyping
platform (HTPP). The HTPP allows researchers to screenmassive numbers of individual plants at a very low cost. HTPP
aims to produce high-density phenotypes on very large numbers
of individuals or breeding lines across time and space at low costusing remote or proximal sensing. This can increase both the ac-
curacy and intensity of selection and, therefore, the selection
response while decreasing phenotyping costs. The main idea ofHTPP is to use predictor traits related to grain yield, disease

resistance, or end-use quality that could be advantageous in
early-generation testing of lines ( Rutkoski et al., 2016 ). Previous
research has shown the potential of HTPP methods in the GPaccuracy of several traits ( Crain et al., 2018 ;Juliana et al.,
2019a ;Gala´n et al., 2020 ;Wang et al., 2023b ).
INTEGRATING OTHER OMICS DATA
GP relies on estimating the phenotypic performance of individuals
from their genomic proﬁle. The genomic proﬁle, however, must bet r a n s c r i b e dt oR N A( t R N A ,s R N A ,m R N A )a n dt h e nt r a n s l a t e dt op r o -
tein before being expressed as a phenotype ( Cobb, 2017 ). These
results come from transcriptomics and proteomics research,respectively. The integration of this intermediate phenotype data
(i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) with
genomic data has demonstrated the potential to improve GPaccuracy ( Hu et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2019 ;Haile et al., 2020 ;Martini
et al., 2022 ;Wang et al., 2023a ,2023b ). Multi-omics-based GP has
been implemented successfully, improving prediction accuracy inseveral crops such as maize ( Guo et al., 2016 ;Zenke-Philippi et al.,
2016 ;Westhues et al., 2017 ;Xu et al., 2017 ;Schrag et al., 2018 ),
wheat ( Zhao et al., 2015 ), oats ( Hu et al., 2021 ), barley ( Wu et al.,
2022 ), rice ( Hu et al., 2019 ;Wang et al., 2019 ), and rapeseed
(Knoch et al., 2021 ).
Schrag et al. (2018) reported combining messenger RNA (mRNA)
with pedigree and genomic datasets, resulting in beneﬁcial
improvements in r
MG to estimate the breeding values of
agronomic traits in untested maize hybrids. Hu et al. (2019)
outlined an rMGimprovement in four yield and yield-related traits
of untested rice RILs through a multi-layered least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator model integrating transcrip-tome and metabolome along with genomic proﬁles in a singlemodel. Incorporating both transcriptomic and metabolomic
proﬁles to the genomic datasets has also improved the r
MGof
several agronomic and seed nutritional traits of oats from multi-environment trials ( Hu et al., 2021 ). Recently, advanced
statistical machine-learning algorithms have been developed
to incorporate the multi-omics intermediaries with efﬁcientcomputing performance to leverage the GP models ( Hu et al.,
2021 ;Wang et al., 2023a ,2023b ). Nonetheless, model
overﬁtting and spatial-temporal features accompanying the inter-mediaries should be cautiously considered during implementa-tion of the omics proﬁles of plants in GP research ( Yan and
Wang, 2023 ).
STATISTICAL MACHINE-LEARNING
METHODS
Statistical methods play a central role in GP, since the effect of
DNA markers is estimated by modeling the mathematical rela-tionships between the genotypic and phenotypic data provided
in the TRS. Thereafter, evaluated markers are provided with spe-
ciﬁc weights to their phenotypic effect that allow the genomicbreeding values of candidate individuals in the BS to be esti-
mated. Hence, GP is a statistical machine-learning approach
that aims to train, develop, and analyze the performance ofmodels with the data from the TRS ( Tong and Nikoloski, 2021 ;
Montesinos Lo ´pez et al., 2022a ,2022b ,2023 ).Meuwissen et al.
(2001) by simulating the effect of approximately 50 000 marker
haplotypes with a modiﬁed linear least squares regression,BLUP, and two Bayesian statistical methods (BayesA and
BayesB).
Several statistical machine-learning methods have been pro-
posed for GP over the last 20 years ( Figure 4 ). As most of the
available datasets in genomics for plant and animal breedingapplications try to ﬁnd the relationship between the response
variable (output) and thousands or even millions of SNP
markers as inputs (or predictors, p), the framework for training
these models is where more inputs are available than
observations (observations, n), that is, p>>n, which presents
a major challenge. This phenomenon leads the advent ofdifferent penalization (regularization) approaches ( Meuwissen
et al., 2001 ;De Los Campos et al., 2013 ). Hence, the different
regularization mechanisms applied to estimate genome-wide
SNP marker effects from a regression with large pwith small n
has led to the emergence of numerous statistical machine-
learning approaches ( Montesinos Lo ´pez et al., 2022a ,
2022b ). These statistical machine-learning algorithms perform
differently, and their suitability and performance depend on
coping with several factors that arise from the multi-
dimensionality of genome-wide SNP markers and the geneticcomplexity of multi-factorial traits ( De Los Campos et al., 2010 ).
Consequently, no statistical machine-learning model can be
singled out as outperforming other available algorithms andgiving the highest possible GP accuracy that has been veriﬁedby numerous empirical and simulation researches and its
theoretical support given by the ‘‘no-free-lunch’’ theorem ( Azodi
et al., 2019 ;Montesinos Lo ´pez et al., 2022a ,2022b ). These
statistical models can be grouped as parametric, semi-
parametric, and non-parametric models ( Montesinos Lo ´pez
et al., 2022a ,2022b ).
Parametric models are developed from the assumption that
the independent or predictor variables take a predeterminedfunction with the dependent or response variables. Some ex-amples of parametric models are linear multiple regression,
non-linear regression, logistic re gression, multinomial regres-
sion, and Poisson regression ( Montesinos Lo ´pez et al.,
2022a ,2022b ). Non-parametric models are a class of statisti-
cal and machine-learning models that do not make explicit as-
sumptions about the functional form or distribution of the un-derlying data. Predictors are not predeﬁned in this class of
models but are instead crafted on the basis of insights ex-
tracted from the data ( Montesinos Lo
´pez et al., 2022a ,
2022b ). Unlike parametric models, which assume speciﬁc
mathematical forms for relationships between variables (e.g.,
linear regression), non-parametric models offer more ﬂexibilityby allowing the data to determine the structure of the model.These models are particularly useful when dealing with com-
plex or unknown relationships, as they can adapt to various
data patterns without requiring predeﬁned parameter speciﬁ-cations. Non-parametric models include methods such as
kernel density estimation, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees,
gradient boosting machine, and random forest. A semi-parametric model is a statistical machine-learning approach
where a portion of the predictors is not constrained to prede-
termined mathematical forms, while another portion adheres toknown functional relationships with the response variable. This
blend of ﬂexibility and structure is exempliﬁed by equations
such as

y=b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+mðxÞ+e; (Equation 1)
y=exp ðb1x1+b2x2+b3x3Þ+mðxÞ+e: (Equation 2)
In the context of GP models, a classical example is Bayesian or
mixed models with linear components for environmental effectsand non-linear (Gaussian kernel, or other types of kernels) compo-
nents for genotype effects ( Montesinos Lo ´pez et al., 2022a ,
2022b ). Essentially, semi-parametric models represent a combina-
tion of both parametric and non-parametric modeling techniques.
Most of the currently available statistical machine-learning models
classiﬁed in the three mentioned groups are presented in Figure 4 .
Modeling genotype 3environment interaction
In studies involving multiple environments, genetic association
and prediction models are usually developed from summarizedphenotypic data across environments or separate models for
each environment. Another approach to account for multiple en-vironments is using an environment index, which for example can
be derived from environmental conditions such as temperature
and photoperiod ( Guo et al., 2020a ,2020b ,2020c ,2020d ).
Growing degree days was earlier proposed as a promising
example of an environment index for capturing ﬂowering
time plasticity in rice ( Guo et al. 2020a ).Li et al. (2021)
proposed that a carefully developed environment index can
replace phenotypic means obtained through conventional
measurements and can model observed phenotype and alsopredict phenotypic performance in new environments, and they
tested their hypothesis on three different traits in wheat and oat
ﬁeld trials. Similarly, in sorghum, diurnal temperature rangeduring the rapid growth period was found to be an effectiveenvironment index ( Mu et al., 2022 ). Taken together, these
studies highlight the importance of studying phenotypicFigure 4. List of the statistical machine-learning models currently in use for genomic prediction.
All these statistical machine-learning models are classiﬁed into three major categories: parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric. The p arametric
statistical machine-learning models include modiﬁed least square regression (MLS) ( Meuwissen et al., 2001 ), partial least square regression (PLS)
(Montesinos Lo ´pez et al., 2022a ;2022b ), principal components regression (PCR) ( Solberg et al., 2009 ), independent components regression (ICR)

EN (AEN) ( Zou and Zhang, 2009 ). The semi-parametric method includes the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) model ( Gianola et al., 2006 ) and the
mixed and Bayesian models combined with the RKHS model. The non-parametric method comprises gradient boosting machine (GBM) ( Li et al., 2018 ),
extreme gradient boosting (XgBoost) ( Chen and He, 2014 ), support vector machine (SVM) ( Maenhout et al., 2007 ), rankSVM ( Blondel et al., 2015 ),

plasticity under G 3E interaction and exploring derived
environmental indices for modeling and predicting phenotypesin untested environments.
The reaction norm model
Multi-environment trials for assessing G 3E play an important role
in plant breeding for selecting high-performing and stable linesacross environments. For instance, the multi-environment linear
mixed models accounting for correlated environmental struc-
tures within the G-BLUP framework increased accuracy whenpredicting the performance of unobserved phenotypes using
pedigree and molecular markers ( Zhang et al., 2015 ).Burguen ˜o
et al. (2012) proposed and effectively applied a marker and
pedigree G-BLUP model for assessing G 3E, while Heslot et al.
(2014) incorporated crop modeling data on the genomic G 3E
prediction. Jarquı ´n et al. (2014) developed a reaction norm
model, an extension of the G-BLUP model, where the main andinteraction effects of markers and environmental covariates are
introduced using highly dimensional random variance-
covariance structures of markers and environmental covariables.The model has been successfully applied in GP prediction of
breeding values using pedigree and genomic relationships
(Pe´rez-Rodrı ´guez et al., 2015 ;Velu et al., 2018 ).
Here, the baseline model for the phenotypes ( y
ij) can be
described as
yij=m+Ei+Lj+ELij+eij; (Equation 3)
where mis the overall mean, Ei(i=1,.,I) is the random effect of
theith environment, Ljis the random effect of the jth line ( j=
1,.,J),ELijis the interaction between the ith environment and
thejth line, and eijis the random error term. The assumptions
are as follows: Ei/C24iidNð0;s2
EÞ,Lj/C24iidNð0;s2
LÞ;ELij/C24iidNð0;s2
ELÞ, and
eij/C24iidNð0;s2
eÞ, with N(.,.) denoting a normal density and iid standing
for independent and identically distributed. Markers can be intro-
duced in Equation 3 such that the effect of line ( Lj) can be
replaced by gjdeﬁned by the regression on marker covariates
(it approximates the genetic value of the jth line). The vector
containing the genomic values is g/C24Nð0;Gs2
gÞ, where s2
gis
the genomic variance and Gis a genomic relationship matrix
(Vanraden, 2008 ). Furthermore, the effects of line ( Lj) can be
replaced by aj, with a/C24Nð0;As2
aÞ, where Ais the additive
relationship matrix derived from pedigree and s2
ais the additive
variance.
The marker 3environment interaction model
The marker 3environment (M 3E) interaction model proposed by
Lopez-Cruz et al. (2015) breaks down the marker effects into
components that are common across environments (stability)and environment-speciﬁc deviations (interaction). This model
borrows information across environments while allowing marker
effects to change across environments. This method can be im-plemented using both shrinkage and variable selection methods
and thus can be used to identify genomic regions with stable ef-
fect across environments and regions that are responsible for G 3
E. However, it is noteworthy that the M 3E model is best suited for
joint analysis of positively correlated environments ( Lopez-Cruz
et al., 2015 ).Crossa et al. (2016a) successfully applied the M 3
E GP model to predict untested individuals and dissectgenomic regions with stable effect across environments and
with environment-speciﬁc effect.
IMPLEMENTING GENOMIC PREDICTION
AT DIFFERENT BREEDING STAGES
There are various uses of GP in breeding crops. The ﬁrst is in pre-
breeding, either to search for desired accessions based on their
GEBVs in a gene bank ( Crossa et al., 2016b ;Dzievit et al., 2021 ;
Bohra et al., 2022 ;El Hanaﬁ et al., 2023 ) or to identify elite parents
for further crossing ( Gaynor et al., 2017 ;Chung and Liao, 2022 ).
GP allows a cost-effective approach for selecting interesting
germplasm held in gene banks ( Yu et al., 2016 ), thus increasing
the use of this germplasm—particularly those lacking pedigreeinformation and data evaluation—in plant breeding ( Jiang et al.,
2021 ). It also speeds up the introgression of exotic germplasm
into the elite breeding pool ( Crossa et al., 2016b ), as
shown recently in wheat improvement ( Schulthess et al., 2022 ).
GP may also be used for increasing genetic gains by
selecting promising germplasm at early stages ( Kadam et al.,
2016 ;Rembe et al., 2022 ) or for feeding them into a genomic
recurrent selection (GRS) approach ( Bassi et al., 2016 ;
Biswas et al., 2023 ), as well as for accelerating the cultivar
development pipeline ( Balle´n-Taborda et al., 2022 ). GRS
facilitates the recycling of parents in a breeding program. The
success of GP in any of these breeding stages, however, reliesmainly on the trait architecture and its heritability.
A challenge faced by plant breeding is to predict performance
across sites over years or cropping seasons. GP may allow esti-mation of the robustness of desired productivity or quality traits
across the target population of environments. Such an approach
improves the efﬁciency of multi-environment testing and itsfurther use in the cultivar development pipeline because it elimi-
nates mediocre breeding lines in the early stages, thus saving
time and resources. In this regard, as shown by Atanda et al.
(2021b) , sparse testing using GP may also be a valuable
approach for increasing the number of trial environments
without increasing costs but keeping the selection intensity inthe early stages of evaluation. Montesinos-Lo ´pez et al. (2023b)
showed that a signiﬁcant gain in the number of new lines to be
evaluated could be obtained by using sparse testing methods
without a relevant increase of required resources. The authorsdemonstrated that with a conventional block design capacity to
evaluate only 225 lines, the number could be increased to 269,
308, and 475 with a sparse testing design using 85%, 75%,and 50% as training increasing the number of lines by 19.56%,
36.89%, and 111.11%, respectively.
GP has further found extensive application in predicting hetero-
sis, encompassing both high-parent and mid-parent heterosis,
across a diverse range of crops, including maize ( Albrecht
et al., 2011 ,2014 ;Riedelsheimer et al., 2013 ;Beyene et al.,
2015 ,2019 ;Cantelmo et al., 2017 ;Zhang et al., 2022 ), rice ( Xu
et al., 2014 ,2018 ;Huang et al., 2015 ;Cui et al., 2020 ), barley
(Philipp et al., 2016 ;Li et al., 2017
), wheat ( Basnet et al., 2019 ;
Zhao et al., 2021 ), sorghum ( Sapkota et al., 2022 ;Kent et al.,
2023 ;Maulana et al., 2023 ), ryegrass ( Grinberg et al., 2016 ),
and pumpkin ( Wu et al., 2019 ). Notably, the predictive scope of
GP extends beyond conventional traits such as yield and its
564 Molecular Plant 17, 552–578, April 1 2024 ª2024 The Author.Molecular Plant Genomic selection in plant breeding
components ( Grinberg et al., 2016 ;He et al., 2016 ;Philipp et al.,
2016 ;Wu et al., 2019 ) to encompass a wider spectrum of
characteristics, such as biotic and abiotic stress tolerances(Lorenz et al., 2012 ;Arojju et al., 2018 ), nutrient utilization
efﬁciency ( Zhao et al., 2020 ), and biofortiﬁcation of crops with
several micronutrients ( Velu et al., 2016 ;Mageto et al., 2020 ;
Rakotondramanana et al., 2022 ;Tadesse et al., 2023 ).
ACHIEVEMENTS
The task of applying GS in breeding is to enhance genetic gains per
year at a lower cost and in less time compared to the conventionalbreeding methods. Given a vector of true breeding values of an
individual a
0=½a1a2.at/C138and the vector of economic
weights w0=½w1w2.wt/C138forttraits, the net genetic merit is
H=w0a0. The response to multi-trait genetic gains can be written
as H =ðksHrH;IÞ=L,w h e r e kis intensity of selection (the standard-
ized selection differential), sHis the standard deviation of H ;rH;Iis
the correlation between H and any phenotypic or genomic index
I, and Lis the time required for I to complete one selection cycle
(in a standard breeding program this takes several years). The se-lection response is the most important breeder’s equation, and fac-
tors that increase the numerator or decrease the denominator of R
will increase the overall genetic gains of the target traits. Simulationand empirical results have shown that GS can increase geneticgains by shortening the breeding interval cycle ( L)( r a p i ds e l e c t i o n
cycle) or increasing testing efﬁciency by performing sparse ﬁeld
evaluation ( Tessema et al., 2020 ;Xu et al., 2020 ;Atanda et al.,
2022 ;Dreisigacker et al., 2023 ). To achieve a shorter interval
cycle ( I), the most favorable situation for GS is prediction within
full-sib families, since the biparental populations have very highLD between marker alleles and QTL alleles with no pedigree, family,
or group structure. Estimated prediction accuracies for biparental
populations should thus be considered the maximum attainablein closed rapid-cycle marker-only selection. Several research
conﬁrmed the efﬁciency of GS for early-generation rapid cycling
(Massman et al., 2013 ;Zhang et al., 2017c ;Bonnett et al., 2022 ;
Dreisigacker et al., 2023 ).
Two showcases are provided to elucidate the ongoing empirical
research facilitated by GS from public and private breedingprograms.
Showcase 1: Genetic gains of maize in Africa
Most GS results in maize have been achieved by rapid cycling ofbiparental populations. For example, the F
2:3segregating popula-
tions were crossed with a tester, usually from the opposite heterotic
group. CIMMYT’s Global Maize Program designed a GS rapid cy-
cle of multi-parental crosses. Fifteen elite tropical maize lines werecrossed in diallel fashion to form cycle 0 (C
0)c o m p r i s i n g1 0 0 0
plants, which were genotyped with 1 000 000 genotyping-by-
sequencing (GBS) SNP markers and phenotyped at three locations
in Mexico. The best phenotypic plants were selected to form theparents for GS cycle 1 (C
1). The C 1parents were intercrossed
and the progeny was genotyped with the same GBS markers as
used for the C 0population. Genomic-enabled prediction for grain
yield for the individuals in the C 1population was performed in
each of the three environments; based on the predicted values, se-
lection was made to form the parents of the C 2population. As
before, the parents were intercrossed and genotyped to form theC2population, and plants were selected based on the GP for grain
yield. GP and GS were performed for two more cycles. Two cyclesper year were performed; and at the end of the second year, seedsfrom cycles C
0,C1,C2,C3,and C 4were collected, assembled, and
sown at three locations in Mexico (Agua Fria, Cotaxtla, and Tlaltiza-
pan). Fifty entries were sown per genomic cycle at each location,together with two widely used commercial tropical maize hybrids.
The average genetic grain yield gains were 0.134 t ha
/C01with C 0pro-
ducing 6.653 t ha/C01. Grain yield of C 1was slightly lower (6.488), and
cycles C 2,C3,and C 4produced means of 7.022, 6.879, and 7.126 t
ha/C01, respectively. Cycles C 2and C 4were signiﬁcantly different
from the rest (least signiﬁcant difference at the 0.05 probabilitylevel). Results from two other locations in Mexico are being pro-cessed, and the complete results of this multi-parental maize rapid
selection cycle are yet to be published.
In addition, Beyene et al. (2015) previously reported signiﬁcant
genetic gains in maize grain yield through GS in eight CIMMYT
tropical biparental maize populations in sub-Saharan Africaunder drought conditions. They revealed that the average
gain from GS per cycle across the eight populations was
0.086 t ha
/C01, while the C 3-derived hybrids produced signiﬁcantly
higher average grain yields than C 0-derived hybrids. However,
the average gain per cycle using marker-assisted recurrent
selection across 10 populations was only 0.045 t ha/C01per cycle
under similar environmental conditions.
Showcase 2: Two-part GS-assisted breeding at
Lantm €annen Lantbruk, Sweden
The breeding-cycle duration is arguably the single factor that has
the largest effect on gain per time ( Cobb et al., 2019 ). The genetic
gain per unit time is of fundamental importance, particularly for
breeding programs to maintain their competitive advantage, andis also crucial for attempting to adapt new cultivars to a rapidly
changing environment ( Budhlakoti et al., 2022 ). In a conventional
breeding program of an inbred crop, such as wheat, barley, oroats, new parents are typically selected during the advanced
yield trial stage, which results in a breeding cycle of around 5 /C08
years.
In Lantm €annen, the GS-assisted breeding program of inbred
crops is split into two parts: the ﬁrst part is the GS-enabled recur-
rent selection, also called ‘‘population improvement’’; and thesecond part is inbred line development, also called ‘‘product
development,’’ in which selected lines undergo testing in
advanced ﬁeld trials. This strategy signiﬁcantly reduces thebreeding-cycle time by selecting new parents at an early stage
based on their genomic estimated breeding values. Simulation
research supports this two-part strategy, outperforming boththe conventional selection as well as ‘‘standard’’ GS (i.e., GSonly applied at the preliminary yield trial stage) by signiﬁcantly
increasing genetic gain per unit time ( Gaynor et al., 2017 ).
Meanwhile, the two-part GS-assisted breeding strategy bringschallenging issues for breeding programs. First, genotyping a
large number (up 100 000) of early-generation individuals for
high-density SNP markers could be expensive, particularly forsmall breeding programs. Second, a closed-loop two-part strat-
egy, where no new allelic variation is introduced, leads to loss of
both genetic diversity and prediction accuracy over time, with anegative impact on long-term genetic gain ( Gaynor et al., 2017 ).
Molecular Plant 17, 552–578, April 1 2024 ª2024 The Author. 565Genomic selection in plant breeding Molecular Plant
However, for self-pollinating crops where LD normally extends
over longer genomic distances, rapid-cycling GS using a low-density marker set can deliver gains of similar magnitudes ashigh-density genotyping, even without marker imputation (A. Ce-
plitis, Lantm €annen Lantbruk, Sval €ov, Sweden, unpublished data).
In addition, the negative effect on prediction accuracy that resultsfrom repeated rounds of recombination and the concomitant
divergence of LD structure between the training and breeding
populations can be alleviated by introducing inbred lines fromthe product development part as crossing parents in the popula-
tion improvement part. Such a modiﬁed two-part strategy can
maintain long-term genetic gain while simultaneously increasingprediction accuracy over time (A. Ceplitis, Lantm €annen Lantbruk,
Sval €ov, Sweden, unpublished data).
The two-part breeding strategy was speciﬁcally developed for
inbred line crops. Extending the strategy to outcrossing population
crops, such as many forage species, which are characterized by
signiﬁcant inbreeding depression and rapid LD decay, is an areaof active research. For these types of crops, preliminary results
from simulation research indicate that a two-part GS strategy
is superior over conventional phenotypic selection and other alter-native GS scenarios in terms of accumulated genetic gain, partic-
ularly when prediction models include dominance effects (A. Cepli-
tis, Lantm €annen Lantbruk, Sval €ov, Sweden, unpublished data).
OUTLOOK
In this review, we delved into the fundamental building blocks of GP
methodology and traced its evolution over more than two decades,
illustrating its transformative impact on plant breeding. We eluci-dated how this methodology plays a pivotal role across various
breeding stages, aiding in the selection of superior candidate indi-
viduals for further crossing, all while minimizing or even eliminatingthe need for extensive phenotyping over many consecutive
breeding generations. This comprehensive review underscores
the transformative impact of GP on the enhancement of crop ge-netic improvement, particularly in revolutionizing cross-breeding.
The utilization of high-throughput genomic technology enables a
thorough analysis of the entire crop genome, facilitating the identi-ﬁcation of promising breeding germplasm associated with desir-able traits for subsequent selection. By leveraging extensive sets
of genomic and phenotypic data, GS methods predict breeding
values for speciﬁc traits, thus circumventing the need for laboriousand resource-intensive ﬁeld trials. This streamlined approach
speeds up the breeding process, thereby facilitating the selection
of superior germplasm with coveted attributes such as increasedyield, resistance to pathogens and pests, and adaptability to the dy-
namic environmental changes, which are often exacerbated by
ongoing global warming.
A pivotal strength of GP lies in its capacity to unravel the intricate
genetic architecture of traits. In contrast to cross-breeding
methods heavily reliant on phenotypic observations inﬂuencedby both genetic and environmental factors, GP delves directly
into the genetic makeup of plants, offering a more precise and
reliable evaluation of their potential performance. This not onlysimpliﬁes the identiﬁcation of favorable alleles but also enables
plant breeders to consider gene interactions and environmental
inﬂuences in the target trait(s), thus resulting in the developmentof more robust and resilient crop germplasm. From this improvedgermplasm pool, the selection and further release of desired cul-
tivars become more targeted and effective. As GP of breedingvalues progresses, its integration with machine learning and arti-ﬁcial intelligence emerges as a promising frontier in crop genetic
improvement. The synergy of extensive genomic data and
advanced computational models allows for the discernment ofsubtle genetic patterns and interactions previously overlooked.
This holistic approach opens avenues for enhancing crop pro-
ductivity, sustainability, and resilience in the face of challengessuch as climate change and global food and nutrition security. Ul-
timately, GP of breeding values stands as a cutting-edge
approach empowering plant breeders to make informed deci-sions, thus promising a new wave of innovation in agriculture.
This review explored the impact of various factors on the accuracy
of GP with empirical research on wheat, maize, and potato as ex-amples of different reproduction systems. We emphasized that
GP, as a predictive tool, relies on the assurance of consistently
high or, at the very least, commendable prediction accuracy.Nevertheless, it is worth noting that achieving such precision is
not always feasible, owing to the myriad factors that inﬂuence its ef-
ﬁcacy. We elucidated these factors and offered insights into howthey can be optimized to enhance the practical application of GP
methodology. Moreover, we expound upon how GS can harness
the integration of omics and environmental data to further enhanceits accuracy, broadening its scope and applicability. In conclusion,our review underscores that GS can signiﬁcantly elevate genetic
gains per unit of time within crop-breeding programs, but to in-
crease its efﬁciency it is of paramount importance to integrate allfactors that affect GP methodology to fully harness the potential
of this groundbreaking predictive data-driven approach.
