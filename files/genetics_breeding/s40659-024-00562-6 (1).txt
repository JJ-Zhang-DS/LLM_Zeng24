Abstract 
Conventional pre-genomics breeding methodologies have significantly improved crop yields since the mid-twentieth 
century. Genomics provides breeders with advanced tools for whole-genome study, enabling a direct genotype–phe -
notype analysis. This shift has led to precise and efficient crop development through genomics-based approaches, 
including molecular markers, genomic selection, and genome editing. Molecular markers, such as SNPs, are crucial 
for identifying genomic regions linked to important traits, enhancing breeding accuracy and efficiency. Genomic 
resources viz. genetic markers, reference genomes, sequence and protein databases, transcriptomes, and gene 
expression profiles, are vital in plant breeding and aid in the identification of key traits, understanding genetic diver -
sity, assist in genomic mapping, support marker-assisted selection and speeding up breeding programs. Advanced 
techniques like CRISPR/Cas9 allow precise gene modification, accelerating breeding processes. Key techniques 
like Genome-Wide Association study (GWAS), Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS), and Genomic Selection (GS) enable 
precise trait selection and prediction of breeding outcomes, improving crop yield, disease resistance, and stress toler -
ance. These tools are handy for complex traits influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors. This paper 
explores new genomic technologies like molecular markers, genomic selection, and genome editing for plant breed-
ing showcasing their impact on developing new plant varieties.

Background
Since plant domestication around 10,000 years ago, plant 
breeding has successfully developed crops and varieties 
essential to modern society, consistently defying Malthu -
sian predictions [44]. Traditional pre-genomics breeding 
methods have resulted in modern cultivars, significantly 
increasing the yields of major crops since the mid-twen -
tieth century. Today, genomics offers breeders advanced 
tools and techniques for whole-genome analysis, rep -
resenting a significant shift by enabling direct examina -
tion of the genotype and its connection to the phenotype 
[166, 167]. This new era of crop development leverages 
genomics-based approaches, such as molecular markers, Open Access

genomic selection, and genome editing tools, for pre -
cise and efficient improvements [166, 167]. Gene posi -
tion or genomic regions that regulate important traits in 
plants are discovered using molecular markers. Markers 
are typically categorized into two main groups: classical 
and molecular markers. The limitations associated with 
phenotype-based markers prompted the development 
of direct DNA-based markers, often known as molecu -
lar markers, which exhibit greater versatility. Classical 
markers encompass morphological, cytological, and bio -
chemical markers, while DNA markers include a variety 
of types such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymor -
phism (RFLP), Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA 
(RAPD), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism 
(AFLP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), Single Nucleo -
tide Polymorphism (SNP) markers etc. [60]. In modern 
plant breeding, SNPs are extensively utilized as DNA 
markers to pinpoint genomic regions associated with key 
traits, thereby accelerating the breeding process. Rec -
ognized as the most prevalent variations within plant 
genomes, SNPs are invaluable for high-resolution geno -
typing, offering the highest map precision.
Moreover, SNPs are both more efficient and cost-effec -
tive compared to other markers. Their popularity surged 
in the twenty-first century, largely due to genotyping by 
sequencing (GBS) technique advancements. Some other 
novel marker techniques, such as Intron Length Poly -
morphism (ILP), Diversity Array Technology (DArT), 
Penta-Primer Amplification Refractory Mutation System 
(PARMS), Inter small RNA polymorphism (iSNAP), etc., 
have been employed in plant breeding, which has ena -
bled precise selection of desirable traits in plants, genetic 
diversity analysis, and accelerated breeding (Amiteye, 
2021). They pinpoint the precise genetic differences con -
nected to desirable qualities, making it possible to pick 
individuals with the best genomic profiles for breeding 
with accuracy and efficiency. Recent advances in genom -
ics are producing new plant breeding methodologies and 
ways (e.g., association mapping, marker-assisted selec -
tion, genomic selection, genome editing, etc.).
Genomic resources for plant breeding encompass 
genetic markers, reference genomes, genomic and pro -
tein databases, transcriptomes, and gene expression 
profiles. These resources facilitate the identification of 
genes associated with desirable traits, understanding 
genetic diversity, and acceleration of breeding programs 
[112]. Key techniques include genome-wide associa -
tion studies (GWAS), marker-assisted selection (MAS), 
and genomic selection (GS), which allow for precise trait 
selection and prediction of breeding outcomes. By inte -
grating these genomic tools, plant breeders can improve 
crop yield, disease resistance, and stress tolerance, 
enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability. The existing variability among crop species is utilized 
for plant breeding activities, which can also be generated 
through crossing or induced mutagenesis. In addition to 
the identification of genetic markers and the availability 
of published genomes, clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/
Cas9) is promising for application to modern breeding 
and is a novel technology for genome editing in major 
crops [132]. CRISPR/Cas9-based directional breeding is 
highly efficient and saves more time than other breeding 
techniques that use genome editing. It further enables 
targeted genetic modifications, opening new avenues for 
crop improvement.Genomics approaches are beneficial 
when dealing with complex traits, as these traits usu -
ally have a multi-genic nature and a significant environ -
mental influence [102]. Genomic tools provide genomic 
information and facilitate the detection of QTLs and the 
identification of existing favorable alleles of small effect, 
which have frequently remained unnoticed and have not 
been included in the gene pool used for breeding [102]. 
Genomic tools have revolutionized plant breeding by 
enabling more precise, efficient, and targeted approaches 
to developing new plant varieties through genome-wide 
association study, marker-assisted selection, genomic 
selection, and gene editing. In this review, we present and 
discuss the most relevant advances in the development 
of genomic tools and provide examples of applying these 
tools to plant breeding.
Molecular markers: tool for the genetic analysis
Based on nucleotide sequence polymorphisms, molecu -
lar markers include insertions, deletions, point muta -
tions, duplications, and translocations. They are ideal 
when codominant, evenly distributed, highly repro -
ducible, and detect significant polymorphism. The first 
molecular marker technique, RFLP , was introduced by 
Botstein et  al. [15]. RFLP , RAPD, AFLP , and Isozyme 
markers are first-generation molecular markers that have 
been developed and used in genetic analysis and plant 
breeding (Table  1). Advancements in molecular markers 
have significantly enhanced their efficiency, resolution, 
and application scope in genetic analysis and plant breed -
ing (Table  2) [156]. These advancements can be broadly 
categorized into the development of new types of mark -
ers, improvements in marker technologies, and the inte -
gration of molecular markers with other genomic tools. 
Here are some key advancements:
SSRs or microsatellites
Microsatellites, alternatively known as short tandem 
repeats (STRs) or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are 
short DNA sequences with lengths typically ranging 
from one to six base pairs in contrast to minisatellites 
Page 3 of 23
 Kumar et al. Biological Research           (2024) 57:80 
 
(VNTRs), which feature longer repeat sequences span -
ning from 11 to 60 base pairs [115]. Microsatellites are 
found throughout the genome, including in chloroplasts 
and mitochondria [125, 127]. Due to the different num -
bers of repeats present in these locations, SSRs exhibit 
high polymorphism that is simple to detect using poly -
merase chain reaction (PCR). Mismatches, recombina -
tion, mobile element transfer (retrotransposons), and 
DNA strand slippage are some of the mechanisms that 
contribute to the occurrence of SSRs. Common SSR 
motifs encompass mononucleotide (A, T), dinucleo -
tide (AT, GA), trinucleotide (AGG), and tetranucleo -
tide (AAAC) repeats. The creation of primers often uses 
flanking sequences that are conserved around SSRs. 
Developing SSR markers involves creating an SSR library, 
identifying specific microsatellites, designing primers in 
favorable regions, and conducting PCR. Banding patterns 
are then interpreted and evaluated for polymorphism. 
SSR markers are highly favored due to their codomi -
nant inheritance, abundance, allelic diversity, and ease 
of assessment via PCR with flanking primers. McCouch 
et al. [107] conducted a pivotal study on Simple Sequence 
Repeat (SSR) markers in rice, focusing on developing 
and mapping these markers to enhance genetic research. 
They identified numerous SSR loci across rice chromo -
somes and designed primers for their use. This compre -
hensive set of SSR markers has become instrumental in 
rice genetic studies, including linkage mapping, trait association, and breeding. SSR markers, are used in plant 
genetics for various applications. For example, in rice, 
SSR markers have been used to map QTLs related to 
drought resistance and yield enhancement [65]. In wheat, 
SSR markers help identify genetic diversity and select for 
traits like disease resistance and stress tolerance [174, 
175]. A 2023 study on Brassica napus utilized 304 SSR 
markers to evaluate genetic diversity, uncovering a 76% 
polymorphism rate and pinpointing loci associated with 
oil content and disease resistance [173]. The research 
emphasized SSR markers’ effectiveness in detecting 
allelic variation and mapping important agricultural 
traits. Additionally, SSR markers showed cross-species 
transferability, proving valuable for identifying traits 
beneficial for breeding programs and conserving genetic 
diversity. SSR markers are crucial for crop improvement 
and understanding genetic variation [83].
Inter small RNA polymorphism (iSNAP)
Endogenous noncoding small RNAs, typically 20–24 
nucleotides long and have important regulatory roles, 
are widely distributed in eukaryotic genomes [54]. 
These small RNAs offer a valuable resource for molecu -
lar marker development due to their conserved flanking 
sequences, enabling primer design for PCR-based finger -
printing. The Inter small RNA polymorphism (iSNAP) 
technique, pioneered by Gui et al. [54], capitalizes on this 
characteristic. To detect length polymorphisms brought Table 1 Salient features of major molecular marker

on by insertions and deletions (InDels) within the small 
RNA pool, primer pairs flanking small RNAs are used to 
start PCR reactions. It is a noncoding, sequence-based 
marker system and is suitable for genotyping and genome 
mapping [3]. Unlike traditional markers that focus on 
coding sequences or microsatellites, iSNAP markers 
explore variations in non-coding regulatory regions. 
This opens up new possibilities for studying gene expres -
sion and complex traits influenced by small RNA path -
ways, including plant stress responses, development, and 
epigenetic regulation. iSNAP markers have functional 
relevance, as they are closely associated with gene regu -
latory mechanisms. This makes them particularly use -
ful for marker-assisted selection (MAS), enabling the 
identification of traits governed by post-transcriptional 
gene regulation, such as disease resistance and stress 
tolerance. A recent case study by Zhang et al. [196] illus -
trates the application of iSNAP markers in identifying 
disease-resistant genes in tomatoes (Solanum lycoper -
sicum). In this study, researchers focused on identifying 
polymorphisms in intergenic regions flanked by micro -
RNAs (miRNAs) associated with defense responses. 
They developed a set of iSNAP markers and used them 
to screen tomato varieties for resistance to Phytophthora 
infestans, the pathogen responsible for late blight dis -
ease. In maize, iSNAP markers have been used to identify 
genetic loci associated with disease resistance and yield 
traits, enabling more efficient breeding [97, 98]. In wheat, 
they assist in mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 
drought tolerance, enhancing the development of resil -
ient varieties [26].
Intron length polymorphism (ILP)
In eukaryotic genomes, introns are prevalent and found 
throughout various gene components. Due to their lower 
selective pressure, Introns exhibit greater variability 
compared to coding sequences, rendering them valu -
able as highly polymorphic genetic markers. Recently, 
researchers have focused on annotating and leveraging 
gene introns to create intron-length polymorphism (ILP) 
markers on a genome-wide scale. An Intron Length Poly -
morphism marker (ILP marker) is a genetic marker used 
in plant and animal breeding to identify variations in the 
length of introns—non-coding regions of a gene that are 
transcribed but not translated into proteins. These mark -
ers exploit natural differences in intron lengths among 
individuals or populations, aiding in genetic mapping, 
diversity studies, and breeding programs by distinguish -
ing between different genotypes or assessing genetic 
diversity [7]. These markers have proven invaluable for 
large-scale genotyping in major food crop plants, such 
as rice [7, 170], wheat [147], and maize [94]. PCR, a 
widely used technique, conveniently detects ILP markers. The amplification of introns via PCR involves designing 
primers in flanking exons, a method known as exon-
primed intron-crossing PCR (EPIC-PCR). Notably, exon 
sequences tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, 
enhancing the versatility of primers designed within 
exons compared to noncoding sequences. ILP markers 
are particularly advantageous when they target multiple 
insertions and deletions (InDels) within a single intron 
during amplification. This strategy significantly increases 
the likelihood of identifying genetic polymorphism. ILP 
markers are highly transferable across related species, 
allowing for comparative genomics and evolutionary 
studies [27]. For example, in cereals such as rice, maize, 
and wheat, ILPs have shown consistent results, mak -
ing them invaluable for research across different species 
without needing species-specific markers. Liu et al. [99] 
developed intron length polymorphism (ILP) markers 
for plants, identifying 1507 ILP markers in Oryza sativa 
(rice). These markers were highly transferable across 
species and showed polymorphism rates of 85.3%. ILP 
markers proved useful for genetic diversity analysis and 
breeding applications in various crops. A recent study 
by Chen et al. [27] demonstrated the effectiveness of ILP 
markers in mapping drought tolerance in rice (Oryza 
sativa). The researchers used ILP markers derived from 
conserved intron regions of the Dehydration-Responsive 
Element-Binding (DREB) gene family. These markers 
were employed to screen a diverse set of rice germplasm, 
leading to the identification of several drought-tolerant 
varieties. The study showcased how ILP markers could 
be used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associ -
ated with drought tolerance. The QTLs identified were 
then validated across multiple rice populations, proving 
the reliability of ILPs in marker-assisted selection (MAS) 
for complex traits like drought resistance. These develop -
ments underscore the importance of introns and their 
applications in molecular genetics, enabling more effec -
tive crop breeding and resource management.
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms are single nucleotide 
differences seen in the genomic sequences of individu -
als within a population. These are the most prevalent 
molecular markers, and their distribution varies between 
species. Contrastingly, while humans exhibit an average 
of one Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) per every 
1000 base pairs [137], rice displays a higher frequency, 
with approximately one SNP occurring within every 130–
140 base pairs [51]. SNPs are frequently discovered in 
noncoding areas. According to Sunyaev et al. [158], SNPs 
in coding areas can be synonymous or nonsynonymous, 
changing phenotypic features and amino acid composi -
tion. SNPs are the smallest units of genetic variation, 
Page 6 of 23 Kumar et al. Biological Research           (2024) 57:80 
providing a simple and abundant source of markers cru -
cial for genetic mapping, marker-assisted breeding, and 
map-based cloning. [188]. Significant techniques for SNP 
genotyping include primer extension, invasive cleavage, 
oligonucleotide ligation, and allele-specific hybridization 
[154]. SNP markers discovered by two methods, includ -
ing SNP discovery from PCR and SNP discovery from 
High Throughput-Next generation sequencing (NGS) – 
RNA-Seq, RAD-Seq, Genotyping by Sequencing (Fig.  1), 
WGS (Whole-Genome Sequencing), WGR (Whole-
Genome Regression), etc.
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a high-through -
put DNA sequencing technology that enables rapid, 
parallel sequencing of millions of DNA fragments for 
comprehensive genomic analysis. In recent years, NGS 
technologies have identified thousands to millions of 
SNPs in various crops, facilitating genetic diversity stud -
ies, trait mapping, and breeding improvements. Numer -
ous tools are available for SNP discovery, including 
BioEdit, DNASTAR Lasergene Genomics Suite, SAM -
tools, SOAPsnp, Stacks, Ddocent, PyRAD, and GATK. 
Typically, biallelic SNPs are straightforward to assay. SNP 
is detected when a nucleotide from an accession read 
differs from the reference genome at the corresponding 
position. Without a reference genome, this comparison is 
made by examining reads from different genotypes using 
de novo assembly methods. SNP calling is performed 
using read assembly files generated by mapping pro -
grams. Various empirical and statistical criteria, such as 
read depth, quality scores, and consensus base ratios, are 
employed in the SNP calling process. SNP discovery is 
more effective when multiple and diverse genotypes are 
analyzed simultaneously, as this approach captures the genetic variability within a species. There are three main 
types of SNP genotyping platforms: single SNP genotyp -
ing (using PCR with Taqman from Life Technologies or 
KASP genotyping from LGC Genomics), multiple SNP 
genotyping (using SNP chips from Illumina and multi -
plexing from Sequenom), and SNP genotyping by next-
generation sequencing methods such as Genotyping by 
Sequencing (GBS) and Restriction site Associated DNA 
sequencing (RADSeq). For large-scale genotyping, high-
throughput methods such as Genotyping by Sequenc -
ing (GBS), Restriction site- associated DNA sequencing 
(RADSeq), and allele-specific PCR are used [37]. These 
technologies have been extensively used to discover and 
genotype SNPs in food crops, including cereals [barley 
[31, 48, 134, 162], rice [28, 185], and wheat [20]], oil crops 
[oilseed rape [29] and sunflower [100]], horticultural 
crops [cowpea [30], potato [59], tomato [149]], soybean 
[155], and among others. SNP markers are crucial in 
genetics and agriculture, aiding genetic mapping, identi -
fying disease associations, and improving crops through 
selective breeding. In their 2011 study, Kump et al. used 
SNPs to pinpoint disease resistance genes in maize, spe -
cifically targeting Southern Leaf Blight (SLB), caused by 
Cochliobolus heterostrophus. They identified 32 quanti -
tative trait loci (QTLs) significantly associated with SLB 
resistance. The identified SNPs and associated QTLs can 
be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic 
selection (GS) programs to develop SLB-resistant maize 
varieties. SNPs also play a pivotal role in integrating 
multi-omics data for crop improvement by acting as key 
genetic markers that link DNA variations to other molec -
ular levels, such as gene expression (transcriptomics), 
protein abundance (proteomics), and metabolite profiles

(metabolomics). These connections help to unravel the 
complex genetic architecture of important agronomic 
traits, including yield, stress tolerance, and disease 
resistance. By mapping SNPs to different omics layers, 
researchers can identify critical genes, pathways, and 
molecular interactions responsible for these traits [90]. 
This comprehensive approach enhances breeding accu -
racy, enabling the development of superior crop varieties 
with enhanced performance through more informed and 
precise selection methods.
Diversity array technology (DArT)
The DArT sequencing technique is a highly reproduc -
ible microarray-based method for discovering polymor -
phic markers [177]. DArT is a genomic analysis method 
designed to enhance the detection of SNPs (Single 
Nucleotide Polymorphisms) across the genome, par -
ticularly insertions and deletions. It begins with creat -
ing a purposefully randomized fragment library, which 
serves as a genomic representation. DArT libraries are 
tailored for specific research purposes, utilizing suitable 
individuals, whether individual or pooled samples. The 
subsequent steps involve identifying the genetic repre -
sentations, hybridizing them onto the chips, and printing 
the genomic library onto microarray chips. DArT sim -
plifies the genome by initially subjecting it to restriction 
digestion and then hybridizing the resulting DNA frag -
ments onto microarray chips. Data analysis is done after 
scanning. This method allows thousands of genomic loci 
to be simultaneously genotyped in a single reaction test, 
requiring as little as 50–100 ng of genomic DNA. Once 
markers are identified, the need for specific assays for 
genotyping is eliminated, except for consolidating poly -
morphic markers into an array for a particular genotype. 
These genotyping arrays are equipped with these poly -
morphic markers and are commonly employed in geno -
typing tasks [66]. DArT markers are primarily dominant 
and require specialized software, laboratory facilities, 
a substantial investment, and skilled personnel (Sinha 
et al., 2023).
Penta‑primer amplification refractory mutation system 
(PARMS)
The Penta-Primer Amplification Refractory Mutation 
System (PARMS) is a specialized genotyping technique 
used for identifying specific single nucleotide polymor -
phisms (SNPs) or mutations in DNA sequences. It is 
particularly useful in plant and animal genetics, as well 
as in medical research, for detecting alleles associated 
with certain traits or diseases. It is an extension of the 
traditional Amplification Refractory Mutation System 
(ARMS), which relies on the specificity of DNA primers 
to distinguish between different alleles at a given genetic locus [159]. PARMS involves the use of five primers to 
achieve high specificity and efficiency in identifying spe -
cific alleles. Two universal primers bind to conserved 
regions of DNA surrounding the SNP or mutation of 
interest. Two allele-specific forward primers and a 
reverse shared primer are designed to match perfectly 
with either the wild-type allele, mutant allele, or a third 
variant allele, with mismatches at critical positions near 
the SNP or mutation. This allows for selective amplifi -
cation of only the specific alleles in question. It employs 
competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction 
(AS-PCR) and a fluorescence-based reporting system to 
detect genetic variations, specifically single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) [159]. It can efficiently handle dif -
ferent numbers of SNPs and samples to be analyzed. The 
process requires only standard liquid handling, thermal 
cycling instruments, and plate reading instruments.
Furthermore, it is compatible with DNA samples from 
various sources and extraction methods, including alka -
line lysis. This makes it ideal for a direct PCR-based SNP 
marker-assisted selection system (D-MAS), known for 
its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and labor efficiency in 
SNP genotyping. In a practical application, Gao et al. [49] 
developed a PARMS marker for the TAC1 gene, illus -
trating its usefulness in rice plant architecture breeding. 
Having outlined the significance of molecular markers, 
we now delve into the applications of genomic resources 
in crop improvement.
Genomic resources for plant breeding
The availability of whole genome sequences is invalu -
able for plant breeding. Arabidopsis (125  Mb) and rice 
(466  Mb) were early models for plant genetics due to 
their small genomes among dicots and monocots. Their 
genome sequences, announced in 2000 and 2005, have 
been pivotal in understanding key genes and biologi -
cal functions. The advent of next-generation sequenc -
ing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized genomics. 
Among these, the 454 (Roche) and Illumina platforms are 
widely used for crop sequencing. NGS technologies have 
significantly increased sequencing capacity; for instance, 
the Illumina HiSeq 2000 can generate 55 Gb per day, far 
exceeding the human genome size. The development of 
third-generation sequencing platforms like PacBio RS 
(Pacific Biosciences, https:// www. pacb. com/), Helicos 
(Helicos, https:// seqll. com/), and Ion Torrent has further 
advanced the field. These platforms enable the produc -
tion of long reads, resulting in more accurate and con -
tiguous genome assemblies. Third-generation sequencing 
is particularly effective for assembling genomes de novo, 
especially in regions with highly repetitive sequences and 
clarifying structural variants.

Additionally, isoform sequencing from these platforms 
facilitates detailed studies of exons, splice sites, and alter -
natively spliced regions, improving genome annotation. 
NGS-generated sequences are typically deposited in the 
NCBI Sequence Read Archive, making them accessible 
for further research. The emergence of third-generation 
sequencing has enabled the generation of long reads and 
allowed the production of more accurate and contiguous 
genome assemblies [25]. Third-generation sequencing 
enhances the creation of high-quality whole genome de 
novo assemblies by providing long reads that cover com -
plex regions with highly repetitive sequences. This tech -
nology also elucidates other complex repeat sequences 
and structural variants. Third-generation sequencing 
techniques, such as isoform sequencing, produce full-
length transcripts, enabling detailed analysis of exons, 
splice sites, and alternatively spliced regions, which 
aids in refining genome annotations. Sequences gener -
ated through NGS are typically archived in the NCBI 
Sequence Read Archive (https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ 
sra) for public access.
Two standard analyses performed on NGS reads are 
genome assembly and mapping. Assemblers like Roche’s 
454 Gsassembler, Celera Assembler, and Mira are fre -
quently used for genome assembly. Once a reference 
genome is available, variation studies are typically con -
ducted using mapping software such as Bowtie, BWA, 
and TopHat, which align reads to the reference genome. 
SNPs can then be detected with tools like SAMtools or 
GigaBayes. The algorithms for processing raw genomic 
data vary based on the data type and desired results. Bio -
informaticians must present their findings to breeders 
via user-friendly interfaces, often through easily naviga -
ble websites. General-purpose web databases like Gen -
Bank (http:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ genba nk/), EMBL 
(http:// www. ebi. ac. uk/ embl/), DDBJ (http:// www. ddbj. 
nig. ac. jp/), UniProt (http:// www. unipr  ot. org), and Swiss-
Prot (http:// expasy. org/ sprot/) provide researchers and 
breeders with essential biological information. Genomic 
sequence databases GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, Ensembl, 
UCSC Genome Browser, and dbSNP offer extensive 
genomic data, analysis tools, and resources. Protein 
function databases, integrating sequence data, struc -
tural information, and functional annotations, include 
UniProt, Swiss-Prot, Gene Ontology, Protein Data Bank, 
InterPro, KEGG, Pfam, STRING, BioGRID, and Phos -
phoSitePlus (Table  3). Additionally, specialized data -
bases for specific species useful to breeders, such as SGN, 
Phytozome, Gramene, and CropNet, provide targeted 
information for breeding programs. These resources col -
lectively support the plant breeding process by enabling 
detailed genetic and protein analyses, aiding in develop -
ing improved crop varieties.New genomic tools are crucial for advancing and 
speeding up gene expression studies. Gene expres -
sion analysis provides breeders with valuable biological 
insights, helping them understand the molecular basis 
of complex plant processes and identify new targets for 
manipulation. While QRTPCR is an affordable, quan -
titative technique, it can only analyze a limited number 
of genes per experiment. Other methods, such as dif -
ferential display and cDNA-AFLPs, allow the study of 
thousands of genes but lack quantitative precision and 
struggle with low-abundance transcripts (M Perez-de-
Castro et al. 2012). More advanced techniques like serial 
analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and massively parallel 
signature sequencing (MPSS) address some of these limi -
tations. However, the most popular methods today for 
transcript profiling are hybridization-based platforms or 
microarrays. Expression arrays offer several advantages, 
including measuring tens of thousands of transcripts 
simultaneously, semi-quantitative results, and sensitiv -
ity to low-abundance transcripts. Several web resources 
facilitate microarray data analysis, such as Babelomics 
(http:// babel omics. bioin fo. cipf. es/), and software pack -
ages like Bioconductor (http:// www. bioco nduct  or. org/ 
help/ work fl  ows/ oligo- arrays/) and MeV (http:// www. 
tm4. org/ mev/) specialize in microarray analysis. Babe -
lomics was used to analyze transcriptomic data in Arabi -
dopsis thaliana to identify genes differentially expressed 
under drought stress. The tool facilitated functional 
annotation and identified key genes involved in stress 
responses [108] In Solanum tuberosum (potato), Biocon -
ductor was utilized to analyze gene expression profiles 
under biotic stress conditions, identifying genes linked to 
pathogen resistance [194]. Genevestigator (https:// www. 
genev estig  ator. com/ gv/ doc/ plant_ biote  ch. jsp) is a handy 
database containing extensive microarray data from 
various species, with the most comprehensive data from 
Arabidopsis thaliana. Data from crops like maize, wheat, 
rice, barley, and soybean are increasingly becoming avail -
able. Published expression data are publicly accessible in 
databases such as GEO (http:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ 
geo/), ArrayExpress (http:// www. ebi. ac. uk/ array expre

able resources for analyzing gene expression in these and 
other crops. A summary of genomic resources related to 
genome sequence and functional analysis is presented in

Genomic tools for plant breeding
Traditional plant breeding involves selection and cross -
ing of plants with desirable traits over several gen -
erations. Techniques include selection of superior 
individuals, hybridization, and backcrossing. Breeders 
aim to enhance traits like yield, disease resistance, and

quality. The process relies on natural genetic variation 
and careful observation to achieve desired improve -
ments in crops over time. Genomic tools enhance tra -
ditional plant breeding by providing precise insights 
into genetic variations, speeding up trait identification, 
and enabling targeted modifications. They use DNA 
sequencing and markers to identify desirable traits 
more accurately and rapidly, reducing the time and 
cost of developing improved plant varieties compared 
to traditional methods that rely on broader, less precise 
selection processes [87]. These tools help identify desir -
able traits, speed up the breeding process, and improve 
the overall outcomes of breeding programs. Some key 
genomic tools in plant breeding include:Quantitative trait Loci (QTL) mapping
QTL mapping is a statistical technique that combines 
phenotypic data (traits) with genotypic data (molecu -
lar markers) in a specific population to identify genetic 
regions (QTLs) associated with complex traits. Vari -
ous QTL mapping models have been developed, such 
as standard interval mapping (SIM) and multiple impu -
tation (IMP) for unlinked QTLs and composite inter -
val mapping (CIM) for both linked and unlinked QTLs/
genes on chromosomes. The effectiveness of these meth -
ods is evaluated using LOD (logarithms-of-odds) scores, 
with QTLs considered significant above a threshold LOD 
score of 3.0. Access to reference genomes provides valua -
ble genetic information on QTLs, aiding marker-assisted Table 3 Important Databases and Repositories of Genomic Information

selection (MAS). Traditional QTL mapping requires a 
balanced population with known recombination data, 
enabling statistical associations between phenotypic and 
genotypic data through linkage mapping (Lander et  al. 
1989). Identifying QTL locations helps pinpoint genes 
responsible for specific traits and understand genetic 
variation mechanisms [84, 105]. Several software tools 
facilitate efficient QTL mapping, including QTL Car -
tographer, QTL IciMapping, MapQTL, R/qtl, TASSEL, 
PLABQTL, and JoinMap. In the 2017 study by Duhnen 
et al., the accuracy of traditional QTL mapping was com -
pared with newer genomic prediction models, such as 
GBLUP and Bayesian methods, in soybean. The results 
showed that genomic prediction models outperformed 
QTL mapping by utilizing genome-wide markers, captur -
ing both major and minor effect loci. This led to higher 
predictive accuracy for complex traits like yield and seed 
protein content, making genomic selection more effective 
for breeding. QTL mapping bridges genomics and field 
studies by linking genetic regions to quantitative traits. 
However, integrating data from multiple QTL studies 
to identify high-quality candidate loci for crop breed -
ing remains challenging. Meta-analysis, which combines 
results from various studies, is crucial in accurate QTL 
prediction. Tools like MetaQTL reduce the confidence 
interval of QTL, improving location and effect estima -
tion. Other tools, such as solQTL and RASQUAL, offer 
low-bias QTL analysis and data visualization. Meta-QTL 
analyses have been applied to crops such as rice, wheat, 
maize, cotton, and soybean, identifying significant traits 
like yield-related genes in wheat [182] and nitrogen use 
efficiency QTLs in rice [82]. Van and McHale (2017) per -
formed a meta-QTL analysis with genetic information 
comprised of 175 QTLs for protein, 205 QTLs for oil, 156 
QTLs for amino acids, and 113 QTLs for fatty acids. They 
detected 55 meta-QTL for seed composition on 6 out of 
20 chromosomes. They also identified candidate genes 
within each meta-QTL aiding in crop improvement 
program. While QTL mapping effectively links traits to 
genomic regions and detects rare alleles, its resolution is 
limited by parental allelic diversity. Genome-wide asso -
ciation studies (GWAS) can address these limitations 
by identifying trait-associated genomic areas of diverse 
populations.
Genome‑wide association study (GWAS)
Like QTL mapping, genome-wide association stud -
ies (GWAS) employ statistical association mapping to 
link molecular markers with traits of interest. GWAS 
leverages diverse populations and historical recombi -
nation, addressing linkage disequilibrium (LD) caused 
by physical linkage, genetic drift, selection, and popula -
tion structure [71]. This method assesses marker-trait associations in diverse populations, although it faces 
challenges with false positives due to population struc -
ture and kinship (Huang et  al. 2014). To mitigate this, 
covariates for structure and kinship are incorporated into 
mixed linear models (MLMs). Various statistical tools are 
used for association mapping, including MLM, CMLM, 
ECMLM, MLMM, GLM, and FarmCPU. Among these, 
the FarmCPU model is particularly effective at control -
ling false positives [77]. With advancements in sequenc -
ing technologies, GWAS has become a prominent tool 
for identifying loci linked to natural trait variations in 
crops. A population needs to be genotyped once and can 
be repeatedly used to map different traits with new phe -
notypic data. Despite its high false positive rate due to 
population structures and genetic relationships, GWAS 
is favored for exploratory analyses to identify a wide 
range of genomic leads. Unlike QTL mapping, GWAS 
is more likely to pinpoint specific candidate genes for 
crop improvement. It has been applied to various crops, 
including rice, soybean, maize, wheat, and canola. [24, 
33]. For example, in Oryza sativa indica, sequencing of 
517 landraces identified approximately 3.6 million SNPs, 
with GWAS of 14 agronomic traits explaining over 36% 
of phenotypic variance [64]. Myles et  al. [112] used 
genomic resources to conduct a genome-wide associa -
tion study (GWAS) in grapevine, identifying 3,600 SNP 
markers. They discovered loci linked to key traits like 
berry color (VvmybA1) and powdery mildew resistance, 
showcasing the utility of GWAS in identifying agricultur -
ally significant genes in crops. In maize, GWAS revealed 
the genetic architecture of leaf traits, linking variation in 
liguleless genes to upright leaves [160]. He et al. [61] inte -
grated GWAS with transcriptomic data and identified 
candidate genes involved in yield-related traits. This inte -
grative approach facilitates the functional validation of 
the candidate genes. Bioinformatics tools such as PLINK, 
which uses standard regression for genotype–pheno -
type associations [126], and TASSEL, which incorporates 
mixed linear models to account for population structure, 
enhance GWAS studies [16]. GAPIT, another advanced 
tool, efficiently handles large datasets with over 1 mil -
lion SNPs in 10,000 individuals using compressed mixed 
linear models and model-based prediction and selection 
methods [93].
Genome‑based molecular breeding
Advancements in genomics and the availability of pub -
lic genomic databases have significantly improved tradi -
tional breeding methods and facilitated the development 
of innovative crop breeding approaches (Fig.  2). Modern 
plant breeding focuses on evaluating the genetic gain of 
new genotypes by isolating genetic effects from environ -
mental and noise components [12]. Different strategies, 
Page 11 of 23
 Kumar et al. Biological Research           (2024) 57:80 
 
such as traditional phenotypic selection, marker-assisted 
selection (MAS), and genomic selection (GS), are 
employed. Traditional selection relies on phenotypic data 
for genetic evaluation. MAS, on the other hand, uses spe -
cific genetic markers linked to traits of interest, selecting 
individuals based on their marker scores [23]. Genomic 
selection is a more advanced method that considers 
markers with small effects on phenotypic variation. The 
process of genome-based molecular breeding involves 
several steps (Fig.  2). MAS, known for its efficiency, 
reduces both time and costs. MAS is faster as it doesn’t 
require extensive phenotype testing of large progeny sets 
and allows for the pyramiding of multiple alleles.
Additionally, it reduces linkage drag and increases 
genetic gain compared to phenotypic selection [63]. 
Genetic merit can be evaluated in larger populations 
without losing genetic diversity. MAS-based breeding 
programs have been widely implemented in crops such 
as wheat, rice, maize, and tomato. For instance, MAS 
has been used to incorporate the Pi-ta gene into vari -
ous rice varieties, enhancing resistance to rice blast dis -
ease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae [72]. 
Researchers identified the Sub1 gene in a flood-tolerant 
traditional rice variety called FR13A. The gene, located 
on chromosome 9 of the rice genome, was found to play 
a critical role in enhancing a plant’s ability to survive 
under submerged conditions. The Sub1 gene is part of a 
regulatory mechanism that involves three key ethylene 
response factors (ERFs)—Sub1A, Sub1B, and Sub1C. Of 
these, Sub1A is the primary gene responsible for sub -
mergence tolerance and enables rice plants to enter a 
state of metabolic dormancy, where growth and energy 
consumption are slowed, allowing the plant to conserve 
energy and survive for up to two weeks underwater. In 
2009, researchers successfully integrated the Sub1 gene 
into several high-yielding, widely cultivated rice varieties, 
such as Swarna Sub1, IR64 Sub1, and Samba Mahsuri Sub1, using marker-assisted breeding techniques [144]. 
In wheat, Lr34 and Sr2 are two crucial genes that confer 
durable resistance to leaf rust and stem rust, respectively. 
These genes have been incorporated into wheat varie -
ties using Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) to develop 
improved cultivars viz. Avocet S (Lr34) and Thatcher 
(Sr2) that are resistant to rust diseases [184].
Similarly, the enhancement of oleic acid content in 
soybean oil using Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) has 
been a significant achievement in soybean breeding. This 
improvement is primarily focused on selecting specific 
alleles at the FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B loci, which are criti -
cal in regulating the fatty acid composition of soybean 
oil [122]. The FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B genes encode the 
enzyme omega-6 desaturase, which is responsible for 
converting oleic acid (a monounsaturated fatty acid) into 
linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated fatty acid). By modifying 
or silencing these genes, the conversion of oleic acid to 
linoleic acid is reduced, leading to a higher proportion 
of oleic acid in the oil. Oleic acid is a healthier monoun -
saturated fatty acid that is more stable and resistant to 
oxidation than linoleic acid, which is more prone to ran -
cidity. Through MAS, breeders have been able to select 
soybean plants carrying specific alleles at the FAD2-1A 
and FAD2-1B loci that reduce the activity of the FAD2 
enzyme. Several high-oleic soybean varieties have been 
developed through this approach. These varieties contain 
over 70% oleic acid compared to traditional soybeans, 
which contain around 20–30%. Some of the notable 
improved varieties include:  Plenish®, Vistive  Gold®, and 
 Monola® [57]. MAS has been used in barley for yield-
related and stress tolerance traits, resulting in elite lines 
with improved malting quality by transferring the ther -
mostable α-amylase from wild barley into a commercial 
variety [178]. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) tech -
nologies have increased the number of available markers, 
significantly boosting breeding efficiency. Markers such 
Fig. 2 Trait discovery and genome based molecular breeding
Page 12 of 23 Kumar et al. Biological Research           (2024) 57:80 
as SSRs, SNPs, InDels, and haplotypes are now crucial for 
efficient genotyping and constructing genetic maps. For 
example, SSR markers were used to map the Als gene on 
the 3H chromosome of barley, which is associated with 
a low number of tillers [34]. In a study on barley, 83 sig -
nificant marker-trait associations were identified for six 
yield-related traits under drought conditions [1]. Various 
strategies have been applied to identify QTLs for relevant 
traits in these crops, greatly enhancing genomic-based 
molecular breeding through MAS.
Genomic Selection (GS), developed by Meuwissen et al. 
in 2001, represents a significant advancement beyond 
conventional Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS). While 
MAS suits traits influenced by a limited number of major 
genes, it falters with quantitative traits, often governed 
by numerous minor genes, as seen in yield and stress 
tolerance traits. GS tackles this challenge by harnessing 
an array of genetic markers spread across the genome to 
compute Genomic Estimated Breeding Values (GEBV) 
for each individual. GEBV integrates phenotypic data 
with marker and pedigree data, yielding superior predic -
tion accuracy compared to MAS [18, 62]. GS strategically 
selects genome-spanning genetic markers, ensuring that 
all Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) align with at least one 
marker [52]. The first step in the genomic selection pro -
cess is creating a training population of individuals with 
genotypic and phenotypic data (Fig.  2). This data is used 
to construct a predictive model, employing phenotypes 
as responses and genotypes as predictors.
Insights derived from this model then enable the esti -
mation of GEBV for the breeding population, consisting 
solely of individuals with genotypic data. Genomic Selec -
tion seems a viable approach to advance genetic develop -
ment within breeding programs in climate change. Grain 
yield, qualitative characteristics, and abiotic stress resist -
ance have all benefited from using genomic selection. 
This rapid improvement results from the selection of 
desired phenotypes across generations. Genomic selec -
tion offers a significant advantage by reducing breeding 
cycle duration and lowering phenotyping costs, thereby 
accelerating genetic improvements for food security. Fac -
tors influencing prediction accuracy include training and 
breeding population sizes, genetic diversity, heritability, 
genotype-environment interactions, marker density, and 
genetic relationships [96]. Several methods have evolved 
for genomic selection over time. An easy linear model, 
such as ordinary least-squares regression, is frequently 
used as the first step in the genomic selection process. 
An issue that frequently arises in linear models with a 
large number of genome-wide markers is that the num -
ber of markers (p) might significantly exceed the number 
of observations (n), leading to overparameterization. An 
alternative strategy is adapted to deal with this problem. A selection of significant markers is used in modified 
least-squares regression. This log-likelihood model may 
lead to the loss of important data when choosing markers 
with significant effects.
Ridge regression (RR) is a penalized regression tech -
nique that solves overparameterization and multicollin -
earity [109]. The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator (LASSO) is another variant, that may have dif -
ficulties with strongly correlated predictors [118]. Elas -
tic net (ENET) is a modification of LASSO that balances 
the ℓ1 and ℓ2 penalties in LASSO and RR, respectively, 
and is robust to extreme correlations among the predic -
tors [46]. A Bayesian method to estimate marker effects is 
provided by Bayesian models like Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes 
C, and Bayes D [56]. Genomic BLUP (GBLUP), one of the 
best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) techniques, uses 
genomic relationships to estimate genetic values [131]. 
Ridge regression (RR), best linear unbiased prediction 
(BLUP), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neu -
ral network (ANN), and random forest (RF) are examples 
of approaches based on single trait genomic selection 
(STGS). The multi-trait genomic selection technique 
(MTGS), which increases prediction accuracy for numer -
ous characteristics, uses multivariate regression with 
covariance estimation (MRCE) and multivariate LASSO 
(MLASSO). A number of software tools and packages 
have been created to evaluate genomic prediction accu -
racy and make genomic selection (GS) usable. Some nota -
ble tools and approaches are rrBLUP , solGS, GMStool, 
BWGS, BGLR, GenSel, GSelection and lme4GS [18]. 
Genomic Selection (GS) revolutionizes crop improve -
ment, streamlining breeding for precision and effi -
ciency. Utilizing genetic markers, GS predicts crop yields 
(Table  4). For example, Cerioli et al. [21] used the LSU500 
marker set to achieve predictive abilities of 0.13 to 0.78 
in various rice trials. GS is equally potent in disease 
resistance breeding, as seen in Zhang et al. ’s [189] study 
on Fusarium head blight (FHB) traits in wheat, yielding 
prediction accuracies of up to 0.59 for FHB disease index 
and 0.54 for Fusarium damaged Kernels (FDK). Further -
more, GS enhances abiotic stress tolerance. Zhang et al. 
[190] assessed maize drought tolerance with prediction 
accuracies ranging from 0.19 to 0.33 for traits like seed -
ling emergence rate, plant height, and grain yield. Rut -
koski et  al. [136] reported that genomic selection (GS) 
improved wheat grain yield by 15% compared to con -
ventional breeding methods. In their study, GS utilized 
1,056 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to 
predict breeding values, enabling more accurate selection 
and accelerating yield gains from 0.5% to 1.5% per year, 
demonstrating the effectiveness of GS in wheat improve -
ment. In Maize two hybrids viz.  Pioneer® P1197AM and 
Page 13 of 23
 Kumar et al. Biological Research           (2024) 57:80 
 
 Pioneer® P1329AM have been developed using genomic 
selection to enhance traits like yield and disease resist -
ance [153]. GS facilitated the development of soybeans 
with enhanced resistance to diseases and pests, improv -
ing overall crop resilience and yield.  Asgrow®® variety of 
soybean has been developed through GS with improved 
disease resistance and enhanced yield potential [135]. 
These findings underscore Genomic Selection’s potential 
to boost crop productivity and resilience to adverse envi -
ronmental conditions and accelerates the development 
of new varieties with desirable traits. Recent advance -
ments in plant breeding have prominently featured 
genome editing technologies which allows precise altera -
tions to specific genes, enabling targeted modifications 
for traits like disease resistance or yield improvements. 
This approach provides exact changes at the genetic level. 
In contrast, genomic selection involves evaluating the 
genetic potential of plants using DNA markers linked 
to multiple traits. It assesses overall genetic merit and 
guides breeding decisions by predicting future perfor -
mance. While editing is precise, selection offers a broader 
assessment for enhancing complex traits [114].
Genome editing
Genome editing, a powerful genetic modification 
method, enables precise alterations in DNA sequences 
using molecular scissors and artificial nucleases. Its origins date back to successful gene insertions in mam -
malian genomes in 1985–1986 [152]. Three main genome 
editing technologies are Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), 
transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), 
and CRISPR/Cas systems. CRISPR/Cas stands out for its 
simplicity, efficiency, and versatility [148]. Genome edit -
ing in agriculture enhances crop traits, like increased 
yield, disease and pest resistance, accelerating breeding 
programs, ensuring food security, and promoting sus -
tainable farming practices in a rapidly changing world 
(Table  6). Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palin -
dromic Repeats (CRISPR) system is an amazing bacterial 
defense mechanism against plasmid and virus invasion 
[75]. The sequences were first discovered in E.  coli in 
1987 when researchers found conserved direct-repeat 
sequences [69]. A crucial CRISPR/Cas9 development 
occurred in 2012 when Jinek et al. demonstrated SpCas9, 
derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, to be successful as 
an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in vitro. This system 
inserts invading DNA pieces between crRNA repetitions 
in the host CRISPR locus. Mature crRNAs are produced 
through active transcription and pre-processing of these 
pre-crRNAs by Cas9 and host factors. Cas9 is directed 
to the appropriate target locus inside the invading DNA 
by the mature crRNA-Cas9 complex. The PAM motif 
(Protospacer adjacent motif) is often ahead of the site-
specific cleavage that the Cas9 nuclease produces. The Table 4 Genomic prediction of traits in different crops

conventional PAM sequence 5’ NGG 3’ at the 3′ end 
of the target site is principally needed for the SpCas9. 
CrRNA and tracrRNA are combined to create chimeric 
single guide RNA (sgRNA), which directs Cas9 to the tar -
get region and introduces double-stranded breaks. Both 
homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous 
end-joining (NHEJ) techniques can be used to fix these 
breaks. Customized gRNA-Cas9 complexes have been 
used to target economically significant traits in plants, 
highlighting the promise of CRISPR/Cas9 in agricultural 
applications [164].
In nature, there are two main types of CRISPR-Cas 
immune systems: class 1, which uses multiprotein com -
plexes for nucleic acid cleavage, and class 2, which uses 
single-protein effector domains (Makarova et  al., 2020). 
Because they benefit from a single protein effector, class 
2 systems, especially types II, V, and VI, are preferred 
in biological research and translational applications. 
Regarding the class 2 Cas proteins, type-II Cas9 and type-
V Cas12 are RNA-guided DNA endonucleases, whereas 
type-VI Cas13 mainly targets and cleaves RNA. Com -
pared to type II CRISPR-Cas9, type V CRISPR-Cas12a 
(formerly CRISPR-Cpf1, a CRISPR from Prevotella and 
Francisella 1) and CRISPR-Cas12b are significantly dif -
ferent (Wang et al. 2020). SpCas9 requires a 5′-NGG-3′ 
PAM, whereas Cpf1 uses a 5′-TTTN-3′ or 5′-TTN-3′ 
PAM, hence extending the range of target sites in the 
genome. Additionally, Cas12a permits gene targeting 
with shorter crRNAs, possibly lowering genome edit -
ing costs [8]. The RNA-guided endonucleases known 
as Cas9 from type-II CRISPR systems have revolution -
ized genome editing. In the target DNA sequences, 
they cause double-strand breaks (DSBs) [73]. To create 
ribonucleoprotein complexes in their natural environ -
ment, Cas9 nucleases rely on CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) 
linked with trans-activating crRNAs (tracrRNAs) [36]. 
However, single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), which combine 
crRNA and tracrRNA into one molecule, are used in the 
majority of genome editing applications [75]. An impor -
tant sequence is the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), 
which is located 3’ of the target DNA strand in opposi -
tion to the guide RNA. Cas9 nuclease typically generates 
blunt-ended DSBs 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM, 
although some Cas9 nucleases exhibit alternative cut -
ting patterns [142]. After the Cas9-guide RNA complex 
binds to the corresponding PAM, the DNA is unwound 
to create an RNA•DNA heteroduplex with the target 
DNA strand [73]. From the PAM-proximal region of the 
protospacer to the PAM-distal end, the process moves in 
one direction. ’R-loop’ formed by the non-target DNA 
strand is a single-stranded DNA structure that is exposed 
and accessible. Base editing and prime editing, two more 
recent genome editing techniques, take advantage of this property [5]. Cas9 undergoes conformational changes, 
activating its nuclease domains during R-loop formation. 
After activation, Cas9 hydrolyses DNA’s phosphodies -
ter backbone via the HNH nuclease, cleaving the target 
DNA strand linked to the guide RNA and the RuvC-like 
nuclease, cleaving the non-target DNA strand contain -
ing PAM. Cas9 nickases, produced by mutations in either 
nuclease domain, are valuable for base and prime editing 
as they cleave a single DNA strand [130]. Both domains 
can be inactivated to create catalytically dead Cas9 
(dCas9), retaining DNA binding abilities for applications 
like transcriptional regulation and epigenetic modifica -
tions. Many Cas9 variants have evolved since the discov -
ery of Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) Cas9 nuclease, 
varying in size, PAM recognition, guide RNA architec -
ture, spacer length, editing efficiency, and specificity. 
SpCas9, the most popular, contains 1,368 amino acids, 
recognizes NGG PAMs, and supports both sgRNAs and 
crRNA/tracrRNA pairings with 20-nt spacers. However, 
it exhibits a higher off-target editing rate. Specialized 
Cas9 variants like SaCas9 (smaller, 1053 amino acids) and 
Nme2Cas9 (recognizing pyrimidine-rich PAMs) offer 
unique advantages, enabling researchers to tailor their 
choice of Cas9 effector for specific genome editing needs 
[42, 128]. This diversity advances the study of molecular 
biology and biotechnology by enabling researchers to 
choose the best Cas9 effector for their particular needs 
in genome editing. Wang et al. [169] reported a new gain-
of-function OsGS2/GRF4 allele generated by CRISPR/
Cas9 genome editing increases rice grain size and yield. 
Errum et  al. [43] found that CRISPR/Cas9 editing of 
wheat Ppd-1 gene homoeologs alters spike architecture 
and grain morphometric traits and increases 1000-grain 
weight, grain width, grain length, plant height, and spike -
lets per spike. Genome editing has led to the development 
of several crop varieties with improved traits, showcas -
ing the potential of this technology in agriculture. In 
rice, CRISPR-edited varieties such as Sasakure and Nip -
ponbare have been developed to enhance yield and boost 
resistance to diseases, addressing key agricultural chal -
lenges [91]. In wheat, CRISPR-edited lines resistant to 
wheat blast provide protection against this devastating 
fungal pathogen, improving crop resilience and produc -
tivity [174, 175]. Wheat variety developed for drought 
tolerance through genome editing is the CRISPR/Cas9-
edited wheat targeting the TaDREB2 gene, which is asso -
ciated with drought stress response. By modifying this 
gene, researchers improved the plant’s drought tolerance 
without negatively impacting yield. For instance, Kim 
et al. [79] reported enhanced drought tolerance in wheat 
through CRISPR/Cas9 by targeting transcription factors 
like TaDREB2, aiding in the development of more resil -
ient wheat varieties in drought-prone regions. Similarly,

Genome editing Concept Application Reference
Base editors It is created by combining the single-stranded DNA deaminase 
enzyme with dormant SpCas9 (dSpCas9), which cannot create 
DSBs. Base editors precisely install targeted point mutations with-
out the need for donor DNA templates, DSBs, or HDR. Adenine base 
editors (ABEs) and cytosine base editors (CBEs), which transform A•T 
to G•C pairings and C•G to T•A pairs, respectively, are the two main 
subcategories of base editorsA novel selectable marker for wheat and the development of herbicide 
tolerance traits; Development of herbicide-tolerant rice germplasmZhang et al. [192]; Kuang et al. [80]
CRISPR-associ-
ated transposasesIt is an engineered Cas-transposon system that combines transposase 
with dCas9 for programmable DNA transposition. It efficiently inserts 
large genomic cargos into TA motifs in the genome. However, it 
has limitations, including off-target cargo integration and applicability 
only to bacterial cellsType V-K CRISPR-associated transposases that are specifically designed 
to allow for precise cut-and-paste DNA insertionTou et al. [163]
Prime editors It utilizes a specialized protein called Prime Editing Protein (PEP) 
and a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) with an extension con-
taining the desired genetic edit. PEP introduces single-strand 
breaks in the DNA and copies the edit from the RNA extension 
into the genome, offering greater accuracy and versatility compared 
to traditional methods like CRISPR-Cas9Correction of phenotypes and mutations in adult mice with hepatic 
and ocular disorders; Deletion and replacement of long genomic 
sequencesJang et al. [70]; Jiang et al. [74]

in soybeans, genome editing has led to the creation of 
high oleic acid varieties, which improve the nutritional 
quality and stability of soybean oil, offering health and 
market benefits (Zhai et  al., 2020). Alternative genome 
manipulation techniques such as base editing and prime 
editing offer distinct approaches for precise DNA modi -
fications without causing double-strand breaks, beyond 
traditional methods like CRISPR-Cas9, making them 
ideal for crop improvement (Table  5). Base editing ena -
bles direct base conversion, such as converting cyto -
sine to thymine. For example, it has been used to create 
herbicide-resistant rice by modifying the ALS gene [191, 
195]. Prime editing is more versatile, allowing targeted 
insertions, deletions, and base substitutions. It has been 
applied to improve disease resistance in crops like rice 
by precisely altering genes like OsSWEET for bacterial 
blight resistance [191, 195]. Beyond simply modifying 
DNA sequences, CRISPR-Cas9 has also been adapted 
to control gene expression. Cas9 variants that lack cut -
ting activity, such as dCas9 (dead Cas9), can be fused 
with transcriptional activators or repressors to modu -
late gene expression, opening new doors for research 
into gene regulation, epigenetics, and functional genom -
ics. CRISPR-dCas9 offers a non-invasive way to control 
gene expression without introducing mutations. This 
is particularly advantageous in crops where regulatory 
and public concerns over genetically modified organ -
isms (GMOs) are prevalent. By modulating gene activ -
ity instead of editing the genome, CRISPR-dCas9 allows 
for crop improvement while potentially avoiding some 
regulatory hurdles associated with traditional genetic 
modification. In a significant study by Lowder et al. [101], 
researchers used CRISPR-dCas9 technology to enhance 
yield and drought tolerance in tomato (Solanum lyco -
persicum). The researchers designed a CRISPR-dCas9 
system where dCas9 was fused with transcriptional acti -
vators to upregulate genes involved in auxin biosynthesis 
and drought stress response. This enabled precise modu -
lation of key genes without altering the tomato genome. 
A detailed study of genome editing has been presented 
in Table 6.
Regulatory framework for genome‑edited crops
Genome editing raises several ethical issues, including 
the possibility of unintended genetic changes, long-term 
effects on ecosystems, and disparities in access to tech -
nology. Potential risks involve off-target mutations and 
unforeseen consequences that could impact environmen -
tal stability or human health. Ethical discussions focus 
on maintaining responsible research practices, obtaining 
informed consent, and considering the broader societal 
impacts of genetic alterations. To manage these con -
cerns effectively, it is vital to establish strong regulatory frameworks and foster open, transparent public discus -
sions on the use of genome editing technologies [140]. 
Regulations for genome-edited crops vary globally [157]. 
In the USA, the regulatory framework for genome-edited 
crops is managed by three agencies. In the United States, 
the regulatory framework for genome-edited crops is 
relatively permissive. The U.S. Department of Agricul -
ture (USDA) oversees genetically engineered (GE) plants 
under the Plant Protection Act. In 2020, the USDA 
announced that crops developed through genome edit -
ing, such as those edited with CRISPR/Cas9, would not 
be regulated if they do not contain DNA from other 
species. This approach is exemplified by the CRISPR-
edited mushroom developed by Penn State researchers, 
which resists browning and was not subjected to USDA 
regulations because it does not introduce foreign genes 
[13]. However, genome-edited crops may still be subject 
to regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
depending on their traits. The FDA reviews crops for food 
safety, while the EPA regulates plants engineered to pro -
duce pesticides. The European Union (EU) adopts a more 
stringent regulatory approach. Genome-edited crops 
are treated similarly to genetically modified organisms 
(GMOs) under EU regulations. This requires extensive 
safety assessments, risk evaluations, and labeling before 
they can be marketed. In 2018, the European Court of 
Justice (ECJ) ruled that genome-edited crops should be 
regulated under the same laws as GMOs, meaning they 
must undergo rigorous assessments [41]. For exam -
ple, CRISPR-edited wheat developed by Rothamsted 
Research, aimed at improving disease resistance, faced 
substantial regulatory hurdles due to the EU’s stringent 
GMO regulations [11]. The wheat’s developers had to 
navigate a complex approval process, reflecting the EU’s 
cautious stance on genome editing. Canada’s regulatory 
framework is focused on the end product rather than the 
method of development. The Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency (CFIA) evaluates whether genome-edited crops 
require regulation based on their traits. If the modifica -
tions do not result in novel traits or substances, the crop 
may not require extensive oversight [22]. For example, 
CRISPR-edited canola with improved oil composition 
has been developed, and the CFIA determined that it did 
not necessitate extensive regulatory scrutiny as long as it 
did not introduce novel traits [151].
Australia’s approach is also product-based, with a 
focus on the characteristics of the final crop. The Gene 
Technology Regulator (GTR) assesses whether genome-
edited crops contain new traits or genes that would war -
rant regulation. If the modifications do not introduce 
new genetic material or traits associated with GMOs, the 
crop may not face stringent controls [53]. An example is 
Page 17 of 23
 Kumar et al. Biological Research           (2024) 57:80 
 
CRISPR-edited barley with enhanced disease resistance. 
The GTR decided that the crop did not require additional 
regulatory measures as long as the edits did not involve 
new genetic material [45]. Japan’s regulatory framework is evolving as the country seeks to balance safety with 
innovation. Initially, genome-edited crops were assessed 
under the existing GMO framework, which involves 
rigorous safety evaluations. However, Japan is working Table 6 The application of genome editing techniques for the improvement of agronomic traits in crops

towards creating a more tailored approach to genome 
editing [103]. For example, CRISPR-edited soybeans 
with improved nutritional properties are currently under 
review. Recent discussions in Japan are focused on devel -
oping regulations that distinguish between genome 
editing and traditional GMOs, potentially streamlin -
ing the approval process [138]. The government of India 
issued an Office Memorandum on 30th March 2022 
and exempted SDN-1 and SDN-2 genome-edited plants 
without foreign DNA from Rules 7 to 11 of the EPA, 
1986. This streamlines approval, bypassing the Genetic 
Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for genome-
edited crops in India. The global regulatory landscape 
for genome-edited crops varies widely, reflecting diverse 
national priorities and approaches to biotechnology. At 
present, the United States and India employs a permis -
sive approach focused on the end product, while the 
European Union maintains strict GMO-like regulations. 
Canada and Australia use a product-based perspective, 
assessing crops based on their traits rather than their 
development method. Japan is evolving towards a more 
nuanced regulatory framework. These differences high -
light the ongoing debate over balancing innovation with 
safety and environmental considerations in the era of 
advanced genetic engineering [138].
Conclusion and perspectives
The future of plant breeding promises advancements 
through genetic tools, precision breeding techniques, 
and climate-resilient crops to address global food secu -
rity. Key genomic resources include genetic markers, 
reference genomes, databases, transcriptomes, and gene 
expression profiles. These tools are crucial for identify -
ing genes linked to desirable traits, understanding genetic 
diversity, and accelerating breeding programs. Molecular 
markers will continue to enhance traditional breeding by 
enabling the selection of disease-resistant, drought-tol -
erant, and high-yield plants, leading to faster and more 
precise crop development. Genomic selection is poised 
to revolutionize plant breeding. It harnesses big data and 
advanced analytics to predict an individual plant’s per -
formance based on its genetic makeup [18]. This enables 
breeders to select and propagate plants with the high -
est genetic potential, significantly shortening breeding 
cycles and increasing the efficiency of trait improvement. 
Genome editing technologies, like CRISPR-Cas9, offer 
unprecedented precision in crop enhancement. They 
allow for the targeted modification of specific genes to 
introduce or enhance desirable traits while minimizing 
unintended changes [4]. CRISPR/Cas-9 and related sys -
tems (such as CRISPR/Cas-12 and CRISPR/Cas-13) are 
recognized as groundbreaking tools for genome edit -
ing due to their precision, efficiency, affordability, and simplicity. These technologies facilitate highly accurate 
modifications of nuclear genomes. However, a significant 
challenge is the potential for off-target mutations, which 
can lead to harmful phenotypes and limit the broader 
application of genome editing. To address this issue, new 
CRISPR/Cas variants are being developed, and existing 
systems are being enhanced to minimize off-target effects 
by selecting specific single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with 
fewer predicted off-target sites based on a comprehen -
sive reference genome sequence. Genome editing holds 
immense potential for creating crops with improved 
nutritional content, reduced susceptibility to pests and 
diseases, and increased environmental resilience. Col -
lectively, these tools are instrumental in developing crop 
varieties that meet the challenges of a growing global 
population, changing climates, and sustainable agricul -
ture practices. However, ethical, regulatory, and safety 
considerations will shape their future deployment.
